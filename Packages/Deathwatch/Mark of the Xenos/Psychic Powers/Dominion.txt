of the Hive Mind and strengthens its links to the indomitable
alien will, projecting a blanket of control and purpose
through its synapse to all Tyranid bio-forms nearby. While
this power is in effect, the Tyranid creature's Synapse range
(see Deathwatch page 135) is doubled. In addition, the
hardened resolve of the Hive Mind gives both the creature
and all other creatures with the Tyranid Trait affected by the
power +10 to all Willpower test for its duration.",
