Lance is primarily used against heavily armoured targets
and vehicles. Taking the form of a single concentrated
beam of energy, it can strike a single target within range.
The Zoanthrope does not need to hit with the Warp Lance,
though its Focus Power Test is modified as if it were making
a ranged attack at the target, taking into account such things
as range and concealment. Warp Lance inflicts 2d10 Energy
Damage x PR, with a Penetration of 5 x PR.",
