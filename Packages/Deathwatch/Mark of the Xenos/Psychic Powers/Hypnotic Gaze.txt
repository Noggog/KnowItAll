	"content" : "The Broodlord can use its powerful gaze to
snare the mind of a nearby warrior, holding it immobile and
helpless as long as its stare remains unbroken. The Broodlord
can affect a single enemy with this power, provided it can make
eye contact with its intended target. If the target succumbs to
the power, it is then held immobile (counts as being Helpless)
until it can break free by winning an Opposed Willpower
Test at the start of any of its turns, or the Broodlord’s gaze is
somehow broken.",
