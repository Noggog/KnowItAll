	"content" : "The Tyranid creature infuses a nearby brood
with burning energy and the pitiless drive of the Hive Mind
to devour all in its path. The creature chooses a single Master,
Elite or Troop Horde within range, allowing it to either make
a Full Move, Standard Attack (Ranged or Melee), or Charge
Action as a Free Action once per Round. The warrior or
brood continues to benefit from the effects of this power as
long as the creature sustains it and they remain in range.",
