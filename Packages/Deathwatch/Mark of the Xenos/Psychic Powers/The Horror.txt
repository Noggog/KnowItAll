Tyrant may unleash a wave of horror that gnaws at the resolve of
its enemies. This power may be used to target a Kill-team within
75 metres. Each member of the Kill-team within the range of this
power must take a Willpower test with a –30 modifier. The Killteam
takes one point of cohesion damage per member that fails
this test. All other non-Tyranid (and non-Space Marine) NPC’s
within range of the Hive Tyrant must pass a fear-based Willpower
Test with a –30 modifier or flee in panic.",
