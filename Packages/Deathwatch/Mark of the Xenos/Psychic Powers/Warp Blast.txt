the Zoanthrope blasts an area with power. The Zoanthrope
must choose a single creature within range as the target,
through others nearby may be affected. The Zoanthrope
does not need to hit with the Warp Blast, though its Focus
Power Test is modified as if it were making a ranged attack
at the target, taking into account such things as range and
concealment. Warp Blast inflicts 1d10 Energy Damage x PR,
with a Penetration of 2 x PR. Creatures within 1m x PR of
the target are also affected and suffer damage as well.",
