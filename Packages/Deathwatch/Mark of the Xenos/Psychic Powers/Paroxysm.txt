	"content" : "Summoning the power of the Hive Mind, the
creature assails its foes with crippling pain, tearing at their nerve
endings and filling their minds with agony that makes it difficult
for them to stand let alone fight. The Tyranid creature chooses
a number of foes within range equal to its Psy Rating (or a
single Horde of any Magnitude). Those that fail their Opposed
Test reduce both their Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill to 10
while they remain affected by the power. The pain is also quite
distracting when trying to concentrate and therefore targets under
the effects of Paroxysm suffer a –10 to all Intelligence, Perception,
Willpower and Fellowship Characteristic and Skill Tests.",
