	"content" : "Keepers of Secrets are the Greater Daemons of Slaanesh,
the so-called Prince of Chaos. Like their master, these
Greater Daemons are the ultimate despoilers, revelling in
the corruption of their foes. Keepers of Secrets seek not
only to lead astray, but to debase their victims, reducing
once proud champions of Humanity to twisted vile things,
barely recognisable to their erstwhile kin. To turn a pure
and innocent soul to the worship of Slaanesh is the ultimate
delicacy for the Keepers of Secrets, the further the fall and the
deeper the corruption, the sweeter their satisfaction.",

<b>Aura of Acquiescence:</b> All Greater Daemons of Slaanesh are
enshrouded by a beguiling, soporific aura that renders even the
most chaste and devout of the Emperor's servants into beings
of ravening depravity or reduces the strongest men to drooling
wrecks. All enemies within 5m suffer a -20 penalty to all Weapon
Skill, Ballistic Skill, and Willpower Tests (including Focus Power
Tests involving Willpower) against the Keeper of Secrets. This
effect stacks with Daemonic Presence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Spirit Swallower:</b> Every time the Keeper of Secrets inflicts
Damage on a living creature (i.e., not against foes with the
Daemonic or Machine Traits), it immediately recovers an
amount of Damage equal to one half (rounding up) the
Damage it has inflicted. This healing ability may not take
the Greater Daemon above its starting number of Wounds.
In addition, if the Keeper of Secrets inflicts Damage upon
a player character that survives the encounter, the character
suffers 3d10 Corruption Points."]
