	"content" : "Perhaps one of the most strange, and certainly amongst the
most powerful of foes, Obliterators are shrouded in mystery.
Walking armouries bulking even larger than Chaos Space
Marines encased in Terminator Armour, Obliterators are
masses of twisted flesh melded with weaponry, who look as
if their flesh is in a state of flux. Obliterators are inhuman,
grotesque arcano-cyborgs whose very flesh and blood
can transform into white-hot plasma, titaniumfused
bones, or internal organs that generate lethal
amounts of electricity. Their brains are as much
machine as living flesh.",

the selection listed above. It is assumed to possess the necessary
training to use any weapon it can create and its weapons have no
need to be reloaded. The Obliterator may have 2 weapons formed
at any given time and can fire a heavy weapon single-handed."]
