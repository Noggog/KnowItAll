		["Special Rules", "<b>Aura of Despair and Death:</b> The Daemon Prince is
surrounded by an unholy aura which saps the will from their
enemies. The aura has a range of 75 metres. All opponents of
the Daemon Prince within this area suffer a -10 penalty to
their Willpower. In addition, the first time any member of a
Kill-team finds himself within the Aura of Despair and Death,
he must take a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test, taking
the -10 penalty imposed by the aura into account. If he fails,
the squad takes 1 point of cohesion damage. This means that
the potential cohesion damage from the Aura of Despair and
Death is equal to the number of Battle-Brothers making up
the squad. The Aura of Despair and Death is a mind-affecting
fear-based effect, so any Talents, Traits, Equipment or other
rules which offer resistance to Warp-based attacks or psychic
powers will apply.


<b>Slaves to Darkness:</B> Those lesser beings who serve a Daemon
Prince in war are enslaved by fear and bound by terrible oaths
to do the Prince's bidding. They would slay themselves at his
command and fear him more than the weapons of the enemy.
Any Horde that accompanies the Daemon Prince regains 1d5
Magnitude at the start of their turn as the places of the dead
are taken by fresh fanatics."]
