	"content" : "The Lesser Daemons of Nurgle are shambling, pustulent
creatures known as Plaguebearers. These daemons have
gangling, bony limbs, their bodies swollen with decay, so
much so that glistening innards are exposed through rents in
their skin. They possess a single, cyclopean eye and a single
horn rising above their haggard, drawn faces, their bodies
covered in filth and parasites. Despite the Plaguebearer's
unusual appearance, they are supernaturally resilient to
harm, the gifts of their master having inured them to all
pain. Plaguebearers are constantly surrounded by
clouds of droning flies and chant monotonous hymns,
their gait a staggering lope. Their sonorous voices
attempt to keep count of the number of
noxious plagues unleashed by Nurgle; an
impossible task, for the Grandfather of
Plagues constantly invents new strains
of viruses.",
