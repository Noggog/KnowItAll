	"content" : "Great Unclean Ones are the harbingers of Nurgle, god of rot
and ruin—his greatest servants, bearers of his most sacred
plagues and poxes. They are squat mountains of ruptured,
roiling flesh, covered in open sores that weep with streams of
pus. They burst through the veil with an ear-shattering howl
of glee, delighted to walk the earth once more, spreading
their bounty.",
