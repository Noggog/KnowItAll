	"name" : "Lord of Change",
	
	"content" : "Lords of Change are creatures borne from some impossible
nightmare, immense birdlike daemons with shimmering skin,
wicked curved beaks and multicoloured, spectrum-shattering
wings. Those who gaze upon these twisted prisms of pure magic
begin to feel their sanity shred and reason slip away. Faced by
a being of change incarnate, bedrock beliefs crumble and twist,
and the mind seeks firm purchase in vain.<br>
<br>
Treachery, deceit, capriciousness: these are the hallmarks
of the Lords of Change. Tzeentch's greatest servants weave
scheme upon scheme, a dense tangle of intermingling threads,
so convoluted and eon-spanning that none can grasp their
true purpose.<br>
<br>
A confrontation with a Lord of Change is likely to occur
when and where the creature wills it. Few have ever managed
to get the drop on these servants of Tzeentch, for the Changer
of Ways is the master of destiny itself, and his greatest servants
possess a portion of that power.
Lords of Change tend to work behind the scenes,
pulling puppet strings from the shadows. So subtle are these
manipulations, and so skilled, that often the playthings of a
Lord of Change remain unaware that they are in the thrall of a
deadly Daemon. Secret cults, heresies, revolutionaries, and even
planetary governors have all fallen under the thrall of a Lord of
Change at one point or another. Even Tzeentch's bitterest foes
can be manipulated into fulfilling the Great Deceiver's ends—
under his greatest daemons' careful guidance, brother can be
turned against brother, friend against friend, and the most zealous
of Inquisitors can stumble from the path of righteousness. To
confront a Lord of Change is to wander through a fog-shrouded
mire of lies, ever unsure that one's actions are correct, one false
step away from sinking irrevocably.<br>
<br>
On the rare instances that a Lord of Change is bested, its
schemes sundered and its plans laid to ruin, it will fight like a
cornered animal, drawing upon its incredible sorcerous powers
to fell its foes directly where deceit and deception have failed.
Lords of Change are the greatest Sorcerers in the galaxy, and their
mastery of magic is without peer. The mightiest psychic powers
and spells employed by feeble human psykers and Sorcerers are
the idle cantrips of a Lord of Change, for a Greater Daemon of
Tzeentch is a creature of undiluted warp energy and the mortal
world quakes at its touch. With the merest flick of an elegantly
tapered claw, bodies mutate and writhe, buildings twist and melt,
and beings of madness and horror spring forth, cackling, from
running rivers of flesh. Nothing that is done cannot be undone;
nothing that is made cannot be unmade. To prevail against a
Lord of Change, one's convictions must be firmer than the
foundations of the earth.<br>
<br>
Lords of Change are deceptively delicate-looking. Their long,
spindly bodies are topped by a savage, cruel bird's head. Great
feathered wings extend from their shoulder blades, glittering
and glinting with a thousand impossible colours. Their bones
are hollow, and despite their enormous size, they barely seem
capable of supporting their own weight, often leaning upon
immense staffs, etched with innumerable eldritch signs and sigils.
Their appearance, however, is yet another ruse: Lords of
Change are fearsome fighters, serpent-quick with skin like
iron. They are also lore-masters, and possess a thorough
knowledge of the great feints and fighting techniques of the
galaxy. To fence with a Lord of Change is to invite one's own
ruin; many overzealous warriors have been felled by their
vicious claws, cruel curved beaks and terrible, reaping staves,
disemboweled before they could even lift their blades.<br>
<br>
Though a Lord of Change boasts many human slaves
among his infernal retinue, it can also call upon a dreadful
menagerie of Lesser Daemons when its back is up against the
wall. The amorphous, spindle-limbed Pink and Blue horrors
writhe with the boundless, ever-shifting energy of unbridled
Chaos, warping the world around them as they gibber
and shriek.<br>
<br>
The tubular Flamers of Tzeentch resemble hideous living
columns, studded with still-melting mouths and faces and
festooned with long, spindly arms. The gouts of magical,
multi-coloured fire they spew from their mouth-like hands
burn, freeze, blister, mutate and vaporize their enemies.<br>
<br>
High above, drifting on the currents of the aethyr, sail
the manta-like Screamers of Tzeentch, twisted rays that trail
slashing tendrils below their long, flat, strangely sinuous
bodies. These tentacles are razor sharp, capable of flaying the
flesh from even the most heavily-armoured foe.",

of Change realise that they are merely the playthings of
capricious gods, beginning to doubt their every conviction.
All characters suffer a -20 penalty to Willpower Tests in
the area.
<br>
<br>
<b>Master of Plotters:</b> All Daemons of Tzeentch are master
schemers, their very essence a primal form of deceit
and treachery, and the Lords of Change are the greatest
masterminds of all. No matter the circumstances, a Lord of
Change is always ready to turn the tables on its adversaries.
Once per combat, the Lord of Change may add his Intelligence
Bonus to any one Test.
<br>
<br>
<b>Supreme Sorcerer:</b> Lords of Change know all Psychic
Powers from the Deathwatch Rulebook (and may know
more; if you have access to Rogue Trader or Dark Heresy,
the Lord of Change knows all Lesser, Greater, and Ascended
Psychic Powers as well, plus the Lesser and Greater Arcana
of Sorcery), and may use them as if it had a Psy Rating of 9.
A Lord of Change does not trigger any psychic phenomena.
In addition to these powers, Lords of Change may also
use the Psychic Power Bolt of Change (see page 127) and
any other psychic powers from page 127 that the GM
deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>
<b>Spawn of Fate:</b> Lords of Change are the architects of destiny
itself, capable of weaving together or severing the very strands
of fate. Though a Lord of Change does not have access to
Fate Points, whenever anyone in combat with one spends a
Fate Point, the Lord of Change regains 1d10 lost Wounds.
However, when an individual is forced to permanently
burn a Fate Point in the presence of a Lord of Change,
the Greater Daemon immediately suffers 2d10 wounds
ignoring Toughness."]
