	"content" : "A Space Marine's senses are vastly more acute than an ordinary
human's, their bodies and minds honed to perfection for
waging war. The very intensity of the experience of battle
can break down the indoctrination and conditioning of
some Battle-Brothers. They can become lost in an orgiastic
lust for battle, beyond commands or orders as they indulge
themselves in wanton carnage. Others succumb to the
temptations of forbidden pleasures denied to them in their
cloistered existence: power, wealth, approbation. These fallen
Space Marines eventually come to pledge themselves to the
Chaos God Slaanesh, caught in the silken bonds of the Prince
of Pleasure.",

created Noise Marines affects enemies within 75 metres (the
GM may increase of decrease this range to account for special
circumstances). All opponents of the Chaos God Slaanesh
within range automatically suffer a -10 penalty to their
Willpower and must take a Willpower Test at the beginning
of each of their turns. If the test is passed no further effects
occur that turn. If the test is failed, the individual suffers a -10
penalty to all other tests made that turn due to distraction,
bleeding ears and the like. If the test is failed by two degrees or
more, the victim also suffers one level of Fatigue. Individuals
with a Psy Rating that fail their Willpower Test that may not
manifest their powers in the same turn. Psychic Cacophony is
a mind-affecting psychic-based effect, so any Talents, Traits,
Equipment or other rules which offer resistance to warpbased
attacks or psychic powers will apply."]
