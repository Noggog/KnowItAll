	"content" : "The Deathwatch data-vaults aboard Watch Fortress Erioch
record that Kyrus the Chantleader emerged from the Hadex
Anomaly in 801.M40 and orchestrated a series of devastating
raids on worlds near the heart of the Jericho Reach. A Chaos
Space Marine formerly of the Word Bearers Legion, Kyrus
has made a number of dark pacts with the Ruinous Powers.
These pacts have granted Kyrus the favour of Khorne,
Slaanesh, Nurgle, and Tzeentch, and the Chaos Space Marine
has led large numbers of Lesser Daemons from all four dark
gods in several engagements along the length and breadth
of the Reach. The daemon armies of Kyrus the Chantleader
are a persistent danger to the Achilus Crusade in the Acheros
Salient. Many senior Inquisitors of the Ordo Malleus
consider him a much larger threat, citing a number of reports
indicating that the daemon forces he surrounds himself with
are particularly powerful for their kind.

Captured agents of the Stigmatus have claimed that Kyrus
hails from a Daemon world within the Anomaly, a bleak and
twisted planet that serves as a battleground for the dark gods'
rivalries. This nameless place is said to have a large native
population of mutants and outcasts, all now turned to the
worship of the Ruinous Powers by Kyrus and his followers.

Kyrus has been blessed with many gifts from his dark
masters, including the ability to manifest massive black wings
and two mighty weapons; the pistol dubbed Hateblazer is an
ancient plasma weapon of uncertain origin, and he wields a
daemon-infused chain axe named Corruptis.",
