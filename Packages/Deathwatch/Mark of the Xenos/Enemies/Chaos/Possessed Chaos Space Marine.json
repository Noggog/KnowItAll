	"content" : "The Possessed are demented Chaos Space Marines who
harbour a singular gift: they allow their bodies to serve as
vessels for the daemons of the empyrean. For them, merely
serving the Gods of Chaos is not enough; as such, they
willingly become hosts to these otherworldly beings—
gaining additional abilities and powers in the process.
However, such a bargain is not without severe risk. Possession
is usually agonising and excruciating as the daemon within
morphs and warps the flesh to better serve their needs. Their
brethren look on jealously as the flesh melts, and the muscle
and bone underneath pop and crack with contortions, such
pain eventually driving the Possessed mad—many afterwards
describe the sensation as a “joyous moment.”",

The GM should select one of the following abilities for each
Possessed as a result of his possession by the daemonic entity.
Note that Stinger, Pincer Claws, and Rending Weapons replace
the Possessed Marine’s warp claws.
<br>
<br>
<b>Stinger</b><br>
The Possessed is blessed with a stinger. This can either be
similar to those of the terrifying Daemonettes, or take on
some other form. (1d10+14; Pen 2; Felling (1), Toxic)
<br>
<br>
<b>Pincer Claws</b><br>
One or both of the Possessed’s hands are now pincer claws,
like those of a crab. Needless to say, this claw prevents the
Chaos Space Marine from making use of any gear requiring
the use of hands. (1d10+14; Pen 3; Tearing)
<br>
br>
<b>Rending Weapons</b><br>
Sprouting fangs, horns, spines, or spikes, the Possessed is able
to use these horrifying features to rend armour as easily as
flesh. (1d5+14; Pen 5; Razor Sharp)
<br>
<br>
<b>Feel No Pain</b><br>
Due to the essence contained within the body of the Possessed,
he is inured to pain and physical discomfort. The Possessed
ignores all levels of Fatigue and ignores any Critical Effects
that relate to pain (GM’s option), but not to limb loss or other
damage types. The Possessed Marine gains 10 Bonus Wounds.
<br>
<br>
<b>Power Aura</b><br>
Through some little-understood warp method, the daemon
within is able to surround the Chaos Space Marine and his
weapons with a powerful energy field. This means that all
melee weapons are treated as having the Power Field Quality
and increase their Penetration to 8.
<br>
<br>
<b>Powerful Legs</b><br>
The Possessed’s legs have twisted into a form that allows
him to leap further and run faster than ever before. Treat
the Possessed as having +5 to Movement (e.g., a “standard”
Possessed would have a Movement of 10/20/30/60)."]
