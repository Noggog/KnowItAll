and it is they who form the core of Khorne's vast battle forces.
Bloodletters are amongst the deadliest warriors in the galaxy,
possessing immense strength in their sinewy limbs and savage
in the ferocity of their brutal charge into battle. Their skin is
the colour of blood, and the coppery scent of gore surrounds
them like a shroud.",
