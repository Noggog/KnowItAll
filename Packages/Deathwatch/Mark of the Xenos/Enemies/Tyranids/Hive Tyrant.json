	"content" : "The Master of the battle-swarm, the Hive Tyrant is a massively
built and powerful creature which serves in some part as a
‘leader' of the Tyranid attack on the ground. Akin in power to
a living tank, able to rip through armour plate like wet paper
and wreak indiscriminate slaughter, they are also incredibly
fast and lithe. Some may even possess wings and extreme
biomorphic mutations, often taking the place of unwholesome
weapons which may burn or strangle their victims at range.
Each is also a powerful psychic node for the greater Tyranid
Hive Mind, not merely providing the swarm with a strategic
focus and overriding purpose, but also harnessing the Hive
Mind's raw power offensively to drive fragile human minds
insane with fear and burn out the brains of enemy psykers
who would match their paltry powers against it.<br>",

<b>Biomorph:</b> At the GM's discretion, a Hive Tyrant may be
given the Toxic (1d10) Trait. This Trait will also apply to
the Hive Tyrant's Natural Weapon and Ranged attacks. They
may be given Bone Swords and Lash Whips in addition to
their scything talons from the Tyranid Weapons on page 372
in this chapter. They may also remove the Lightning Attack
talent and take a ranged weapon from the Tyranid Weapons
listed in the Tyranid Weapons on page 372 in this chapter.<br>
<b>Monstrous Tyranid Psyker:</b> The Hive Tyrant is a psyker
but their powers drawn upon the power of the Hive Mind
rather than direct manipulation of the Warp. Because of this
and the monstrous power of the Hive Mind they do not need
to test to use their psychic powers and never suffer Psychic
Phenomena or Perils of the Warp. A Hive Tyrant may only
use a single psychic power during its turn.<br>
<b>Death Shock:</b> When a Hive Tyrant is slain, its death sends a
shockwave through the Hive Mind. When a Hive Tyrant is slain,
all Tyranid Creatures within synapse range (Willpower Bonus
x 10 metres) that do not have the Fearless Talent or Synapse
Creature Trait will automatically break and flee as quickly as they
can (this effect overrides the effects of Instinctive Behaviour in
this instance). Any Tyranid Creature with the Fearless or Synapse
Creature Trait must pass a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test or
be stunned for one round."]
