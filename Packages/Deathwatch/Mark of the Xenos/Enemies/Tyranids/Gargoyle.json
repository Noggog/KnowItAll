	"content" : "Flying at the head of the swarm, Gargoyles are often the first
sign of the onrushing wave of Tyranids, as they blot out the
sun and choke the sky with their leathery wings and infernal
screeching. Not dissimilar in appearance to a Termagant, albeit
with the addition of wings, a Gargoyle is individually weak,
and relies as much on its speed and ranged weapons as it does
tooth and claw. However, in great numbers (as Gargoyles are
almost always encountered) they can make as fearsome a foe
as any Tyranid. The primary goal of Gargoyles, in their role
as part of the Tyranid vanguard, is, it seems, to sow confusion.
They achieve this by peppering foes with their fleshborers
and then darting away before retaliatory fire can find them,
always staying out of arm’s reach and using their speed to
move from target to target before they can be outmatched.<br>
This command of the air and their agility makes Gargoyles
a particularly fearsome foe to fight, especially as they often
descend on enemies from hundreds of metres, swooping down
to strike lethal blows. This forces foes to constantly scan the
skies and be alert for any shadow or flicking form that could
be the first sign of a descending Gargoyle brood. Gargoyles
are also a menace for aircraft and can make air travel across a
Tyranid-contested world extremely dangerous, as they hunt
ceaselessly for prey, often supported by other, more massive
Tyranid bio-forms such as Harpies and Harridans. Fast and
manoeuvrable, it is not unheard of for Gargoyles to ambush
craft many times their own size, latching onto the hulls in
large numbers and chewing through power cables, couplings
and other vital components to bring them down in flames.<br>
Dangerous when beyond the range of Tyranid synapse
creatures, they become even more so when driven forward by
the implacable will of the Hive Mind, pouring down from the
sky upon their foes like clawed rain, forcing their way through
small openings and blanketing sensors and observation
towers with their bat-like wings. Under the direction of the
Hive Mind, Gargoyles will even throw themselves into vents,
exhausts and exposed gears, fouling machinery and weapons
with their bodies. In this way Gargoyles are very difficult to
defend against or trap in a bottleneck, as their ability to fly
allows them to come at their foes from all angles and exploit
any opening they can find. A Gargoyle which becomes
trapped in an enclosed space (as sometime happens when
they force their way through openings) is deadly indeed as
it goes into a frenzy to escape, fighting as only a cornered
beast can.",

<b>Biomorphs:</b> At the GM’s discretion a Gargoyle may have
Adrenal Glands (gaining the Furious Assault Talent) and/or
Toxin Sacs (gaining the Toxic (1d10) Trait on all melee and
ranged attacks).
<br><b>Blinding Venom:</b> Attacks in melee from a Gargoyle have a
chance of blinding its foes. If a blow from a Gargoyle with its
Teeth and Claws strikes an opponent’s head, they must make
an Easy (+20) Toughness Test or become Blinded for 1d5
turns. Enclosed helmets (such as those on a suit of power
armour, negate this ability).
<br><b>Enclosed Spaces:</b> Gargoyles are feral creatures and sometime
become trapped in places where they cannot fly, and go crazy
in an effort to escape. A Gargoyle which becomes trapped in
an enclosed space (i.e., where it cannot spread its wings or
use its Flyer movement) gains the Frenzy and Furious Assault
Talents until it escapes or dies.
<br><b>Gargoyle Hordes:</b> Gargoyles make ideal horde creatures and
can use the Horde rules (see Deathwatch page 359)."]
