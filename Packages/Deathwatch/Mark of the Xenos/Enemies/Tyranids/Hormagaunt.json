	"content" : "A seemingly stable bio-mutation of the Gaunt genus of
Tyranid war-beast, the Hormagaunt is a biological machine,
a living weapon designed and bred with but a single purpose
in mind: to close with a living enemy as rapidly as possible
and eviscerate it with its long-bladed talons and do so again,
and again, and again without remorse or relent until nothing
living opposes it. Unleashed in huge, restless swarms made
up of close packed ranks of rippling claws and hard-edged
chitinous plates, Hormagaunts move across the ground like
lighting quick shoals of deadly fish. Drawn to the scent of
blood, they close in for the kill, leaping, screaming, and
scuttling. They leave nothing alive in their wake.",
