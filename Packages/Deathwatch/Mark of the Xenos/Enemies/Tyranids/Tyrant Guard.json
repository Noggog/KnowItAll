	"content" : "Tyrant Guard exist for a single purpose and a single purpose
alone, the defence of the Hive Tyrant they are charged with
protecting. In this capacity they excel like no other kind of
bodyguard in the galaxy. Their armoured hides and thick
muscles are almost impervious to small arms and highly
resistant to even the heaviest weapons which means they
can soak up an appalling amount of damage before they
are destroyed. Though similar in size to a Tyranid Warrior,
a Tyrant Guard has more of the appearance of a hound or
boar, loping alongside the Hive Tyrant on four limbs, their
massively armoured heads close to the ground and alert for
danger to their master. When they detect a threat to the
Hive Tyrant, they immediately move to block lines of sight
and throw themselves in front of bolts, blasts and missiles.
When in close combat, they swarm around their Hive Tyrant,
keeping the bulk of its foes away so it may deal with them
more easily.<br>
Never encountered without the presence of a Hive Tyrant,
and never straying far from its side in battle, Tyrant Guard are
nevertheless vicious opponents in their own right, tearing at
their foes with large, bladed talons and gnashing teeth, with
an animalistic fury notable even in the midst of a Tyranid
swarm. They do however always remain close to their Hive
Tyrant, like loyal dogs running at their master’s feet and
unlike more independent Tyranid creatures, they cannot be
tempted or lured into pursuit, remaining steadfastly in the
Hive Tyrant’s shadow regardless of the presence of nearby
foes. Some scholars speculate that the Tyrant Guard, not
encountered in the early stages of the hive fleets, were an
evolution to combat the tactics of Imperial forces which
quickly found that destroying Hive Tyrants with heavy
weapons fire was a good way to break up a swarm. Like so
many Tyranid creatures, however, this is merely speculation,
as Tyrant Guard have only been observed on the battlefield,
and most specimens recovered are extensively damaged by
the efforts of destroying them.<br>
What has been established by Imperial scholars and
tacticians is that the Tyrant Guard are among the dimmest
of the Tyranid creatures, on a par with many of the smaller
gaunt genus creatures in their intellect. This seems to be a
deliberate evolution of the Hive Mind in creating a lumbering,
heavily defended and utterly loyal bodyguard with no sense
of personal safety, only the continued survival of its master.
To this end, Tyrant Guard are blind, their heads encased
entirely in rock-hard chitin, save for a razor-lined maw
with which to bite and savage their prey. This is doubtless
a further protection against damage, as the presence of eyes
would only create a weak spot which their foes could exploit.
Despite this seeming disability, Tyrant Guard seem to have
little trouble detecting enemies, and appear to have a kind
of sense link with their Hive Tyrant, seeing what it sees and
reacting to danger instinctively as it becomes aware of its
foes.",

<b>Bodyguard:</b> Tyrant Guard only ever appear when acting as
the bodyguard for a Hive Tyrant and usually only in groups
of 1–3, though at the GM’s discretion larger groups may be
encountered. Tyrant Guard will never stray more than a few
metres from their master, and if for any reason separated from
it, will endeavour to return to its side as soon as possible. While
within 20 metres of their Hive Tyrant, a Tyrant Guard may use
its Reaction to move (up to its normal movement allowance)
into combat with a foe, before that foe enters melee with the
Hive Tyrant, effectively interrupting the enemy’s charge or
move. Tyrant Guard may alternatively use their Reaction to
interpose themselves between the Hive Tyrant and a ranged
attack, effectively becoming the new target of the attack.
Master’s Eyes: Though Tyrant Guard are blind, while within
20 metres of their Hive Tyrant, they can use his Perception
and senses as their own, including any Traits or Talents which
improve them.<br>
<b>Rampage:</b> If a Tyrant Guard’s Hive Tyrant is killed, it will go
berserk, attacking any non-Tyranid creatures it can reach. While
in this state, it gains the Frenzy and Furious Assault talents. Once
begun, Rampage lasts until the Tyrant Guard is destroyed."]
