	"content" : "The Tyranid Warrior is death incarnate; a biological engine
designed for murder, in every aspect of strength, size, and
resilience it is literally superhuman. They are also incredible
fighters, each more than equal to a Space Marine in combat
power, be it with their great scythe-like talons of augmented
bone (sharp enough to bisect an armoured Man in a single
stroke) or the nightmarish living weapons they carry that
spit flesh-boring parasites for ammunition and consign their
victims to a death too vile to contemplate. Tyranid Warriors
also act as vital psychic resonators for the Tyranid swarm,
receiving, amplifying, and transmitting the Hive Mind's
controlling will and purpose to the lesser creatures around
them.",
