	"content" : "The Termagant is one of the basic warrior units of the
Tyranid Swarm, and one of the most commonly encountered
creatures on the battlefield. They are bred and unleashed in
their thousands by the hive fleets in great waves to blunt the
fire of their enemies and overwhelm them in an unstoppable
tide of flesh and fang. Man-sized, but low and hunched
in appearance, they are agile, fast, and extremely deadly.
Termagants are usually armed with a variety of symbiotic
weapon-creatures of various forms, as well as needle-teeth
and ripping claws with which to rend and devour their prey.",
