	"content" : "The leadership cast of the Tyranids is often difficult for Imperial
commanders to identify, and there is often the mistaken
assumption that larger Tyranid creatures are more important;
a mistake that has cost more than one officer his rank and
countless men their lives. This is especially true of Tyranid
Warrior Primes, an evolution of the Tyranid Warrior genus
with elevated intelligence and a stronger link to the Hive Mind.
It has in fact only been in recent times that the Primes have
been identified and reported among the ranks of the hive fleets,
though as many scholars and magos are quick to point out, this
is less likely to be because they are a recent evolution and more
likely because they blend in with the rest of a Tyranid Warrior
brood. Primes are also being encountered in greater and greater
numbers within Hive Fleet Dagon, perhaps as a direct response
to the constantly evolving tactics of Imperial forces and the hive
fleet's need to deal with the elevated Deathwatch
presence in the Orpheus Salient after several
costly encounters.
<br>In function, Tyranid Warrior Primes
take on the role of commanders and
captains within the swarm. Much
in the same way as a Hive Tyrant
might lead a host of Tyranids,
a Prime will oversee a smaller
section of the battlefield or
direct a smaller strike force
of warriors. When close to
a more powerful synapse
creature they will defer
their control, acting as
lieutenants and sergeants,
often personally leading
broods. However, should
they find themselves
alone, they can easily
bind together those
Tyranid creatures nearby
into an effective fighting
force and carry on with
little trouble. In this way, a
Tyranid Warrior Prime is
just as capable of directing
a swarm as a Hive Tyrant
and many an Imperial
officer has suffered as a
result of underestimating
their ability to project the
Hive Mind and lead lesser Tyranid creatures.<br>
Tyranid Warriors Primes have also earned a fearsome
reputation as resourceful and cunning tacticians, directing
nearby Tyranid creatures through the Hive Mind to take advantage of terrain, enemy movements and other prevailing
battlefield conditions. It is often the failing of the Imperium
(and even some xenos races such as the Tau and the Eldar) that
the Tyranids are seen as mindless animals, driven forward by
the will of the Hive Mind with no thought to tactics or strategy.
The truth is of course that creatures like the Tyranid Warrior
Prime and the Hive Tyrant are just as capable as any other
commander, perhaps more so as they have unshakable faith in
their troops and are fearless in battle, making them almost the
perfect battlefield leaders.",
