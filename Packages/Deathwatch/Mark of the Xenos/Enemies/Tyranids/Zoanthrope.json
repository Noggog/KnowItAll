	"content" : "Zoanthropes are amongst the strangest and most bizarre of
all Tyranid creatures. Their feeble atrophied bodies hang limp
and seemingly lifeless beneath their massive craniums, far too
large for their weak limbs to support. Only their immense
psychic power allows them to move at all, drifting across the
battlefield on a cushion of psychic energy. This vast store of
energy and their ability to focus it is also what makes them
such terrible foes, for a Zoanthrope is capable of conjuring
up earth-shattering bolts of warp energy with the strength
to smash apart even the most heavily armoured troops or
vehicles. In this role, the swarm uses Zoanthropes as psychic
cannons, blasting apart strong points and tanks with equal
ease or raining warp fire down upon the heads of massed foes,
slaying dozens of warriors in a single, blinding flash of power.<br>
There is an unknown and alien intelligence which lurks
within the chitin cranium of the Zoanthrope, its actions
seemingly governed by both the Hive Mind and some inner
psychic instincts to seek out particular enemies and use
its powers in certain ways. Despite their power, however,
Zoanthropes sometimes seem to be victims of their own
massive energy reserves and there have been numerous afteraction
reports of Zoanthropes “burning out” in battle. After
hurling numerous bolts or sustaining their shield for an
extended period, their craniums have been observed to burst
and bleed out, sending them crashing limply to the ground.
Psykers who have witnessed these events liken it to the perils
of the warp which normal psykers can suffer when psychic
energy overloads their minds.<br>
In addition to their ability to hurl terrible bolts of warp
energy at their foes, Zoanthropes are also very difficult to
destroy, especially considering how weak and feeble their
bodies appear. This resilience stems from their ability to create
a powerful warp bubble around themselves, shielding them
from all kind of weapons and even turning aside blows in
close combat. Like their ability to drift above the ground, the
shield seems a constant part of the Zoanthrope and is always
present as long as the creature lives. It has been noted that
the shield seems to strengthen or coalesce around particularly
powerful attacks, flashing bright for an instant to turn aside
the blow before fading back to a uniform shimmer.",
