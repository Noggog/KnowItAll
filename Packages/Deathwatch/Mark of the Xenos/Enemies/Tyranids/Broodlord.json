	"content" : "Genestealers are terrifying close combat horrors with the
individual strength and speed to tear apart even an armoured
Space Marine if they can get close enough to land a telling
blow. They stand almost six feet in height, even hunched over
as they are on hind legs, their four arms ending in claws, talons
or other bio-weapons capable of cutting through ceramite
and plasteel with equal ease. Cunning and independent,
Genestealers are also one of the few Tyranid creatures which
can exist away from the nurturing and controlling influence
of the Hive Mind, using their own innate intelligence and
brood telepathy to form tight-knit groups. These groups can
survive for decades or even centuries on worlds, hiding their
presence and infecting more and more of the population until
the time to strike arrives, usually coinciding with the arrival
of the hive fleet and the wholesale invasion and consumption
of the world itself.<br>
Genestealer broods are often led by ancient and powerful
Genestealers know as Broodlords.",

may have Adrenal Glands (gaining the Furious Assault Talent)
and/or Toxin Sacs (gaining the Toxic [1d10] Trait).<br>
<b>Brood Telepathy:</b> Purestrain Genestealers have a constant
telepathic link with each other which can function clearly
and without restriction (such as from intervening objects or
other forms of shielding) up to one kilometre. This allows
them to communicate with each other and pass information
to nearby Genestealers quickly and quietly.<br>
<b>Genestealer's Kiss:</b> A Genestealer possesses an ovipositor
within its maw that implants the alien's genetic code into
its victims. This seeds the host's body with a parasite that
will grow into a monstrous hybrid creature, mixing the
genes of the Genestealer and the host. Over a number of
generations, these hybrid will give birth to more hybrids
until eventually a new Genestealer is born. A host can resist
such an implantation, but only if they pass a Challenging
(+0) Toughness Test as soon as it occurs. Once infected,
the host become beholden to the Genestealer which infected
it and loves the hybrid offspring it carries as if it was its own
progeny. Special Deathwatch treatments and a Space Marine's
own physiology ensure that Deathwatch Space Marines are
immune to this effect.<br>
<b>Tyranid Psyker:</b> Broodlords are also psykers with a Psy Rating of 5 and access
to the Tyranid Psychic Powers (select two). In addition, they have
their own unique psychic power: Hypnotic Gaze."]
