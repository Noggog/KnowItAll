	"content" : "From the edge of the galactic rim, the first tendrils of Hive Fleet
Dagon have coiled around the edge of the Jericho Reach, choking
the life from worlds and feeding on the Imperium itself. Among
this new hive fleet, ancient and now all too familiar horrors
have arisen, creatures spawned and unleashed in dozens of other
sectors and across countless other battlefields. Alongside the
familiar, however, come new and disturbing Tyranid variations,
proving once again that as soon as the Imperium believes it
understands the Tyranid, the Tyranid changes and adapts once
more. For the Jericho Reach, the force of the Tyranid assault
was like a mighty hammer blow, catching the Achilus Crusade
off balance and forcing Imperial Commanders to scramble to
face this new and encroaching threat before too much ground
was lost and too many worlds had fallen. Meeting the swarms
head-on, millions died in those first desperate years of Dagon’s
arrival, and many planets could not be saved, disappearing
forever under a tide of chitin and claws.<br>
It was also during this dark time that Hive Fleet Dagon took
on its own identity among the dozens of other major hive fleet
incursions from the Eastern Fringe. Commanders and soldiers
alike came to know the signs and character of the swarm,
the nature of its beasts and the unique hunger it seemed to
possess for the Jericho Reach, as if it had a taste for that sector
specifically and the worlds that lay within it. They also noted
how it adapted and changed with each world it consumed, each
battle it won (or lost) and with each light year it came closer to
the Iron Collar and the Warp Gate. This kind of rapid adaption
had been observed in other fleets of course, however in Hive
Fleet Dagon it seemed to take on an even more sinister slant, as
if the fleet were aware of the pain and suffering it was inflicting
and the terror in the hearts of the soldiers trying to stop it. In the
space of a few short years, this evolution and mutation within
Dagon led to a number of unique bio-constructs and weapons
never seen before by Imperial scholars; the most terrible of them
all being the Overlord.<br>
The rise of the Dagon Overlord, or simply the Overlord as
it became known, seemed to occur in conjunction with those
first victories scored by the hive fleet, as if the Hive Mind had
taken the measure of the foes it has faced and chose to evolve a
specific tool for their eradication. Other theories speculate that
the Overlord was a genus specific to the hive fleet that existed
long before its arrival in the Imperium, and that it was simply
a superior warrior construct, brought out of storage to face a
more stubborn than excepted adversary. Whatever the case, the
Overlord first appeared during the opening days of the battle for
Castobel, leading a mighty swarm against the amethyst spires of
the Trimalov Hive, rending through its walls and dispatching
its defenders in a month-long orgy of carnage and slaughter.
Those fortunate enough to escape the fall of the hive city with
their lives took with them tales of terror and the memory of a
beast which stood apart from even the worst horrors the swarm
has to offer.<br>
The Dagon Overlord is in appearance similar to a Hive Tyrant,
a creature of terrible and horrific majesty all on its own, but is
different enough to stand apart from its lesser brethren and be
remembered by those that see it looming across the battlefield.
Covered in slimy plates of chitin which constantly drip and leak
fluid, the Overlord projects an aura of horror and menace like
nothing else within the swarm. Its importance and power are also
readily apparent when it strides alongside other Tyranid creatures,
its powerful presence emboldening and maddening the lesser
creatures more so than would be expected by any link to the Hive
Mind. It is almost as if the Overlord is the embodiment of Hive
Fleet Dagon’s ire toward the Jericho Reach and its alien hatred
infects creatures with a personal desire to murder, maim, and kill
all those in their path. It has been suggested that this notion of the
beast’s personal vendetta is just the fanciful imagining of terrified
Imperial Guardsmen, though only by those who have not seen
the Overlord beast in the flesh themselves.<br>
Since its first appearance, the Dagon Overlord has been
sighted in almost all of the major combat zones of the Orpheus
Salient, leading swarm after swarm into the ranks of Imperial
defenders. This has led many to believe that the Overlord is just
one of many, and not a unique creature at all. However such
notions of individuality are hard to determine when dealing
with the Hive Mind, as it is constantly recycling its troops and
adding to them by consuming worlds. This means the Overlord
may well be a veteran of many wars, and may have even fallen
countless times to the foe, only to be re-spawned by the Hive
Mind with a fresh body and a will for vengeance. Both the Ordo
Xenos and the Deathwatch have made attempts to find the truth 
behind the Overlord, if for no other reason than to catalogue a
new and deadly variation of the Tyranid race. Neither has met
with much success, and both agents and Battle-Brothers have
been lost during the process. Even when the Dagon Overlord
seems defeated, it invariably rises again in another place or
another time.",

<b>Biomorphs:</b> At the GM’s discretion, the Dagon Overlord may
have Acid Blood (when wounded in melee combat all non-
Tyranid creatures in melee with it must make a Challenging
(+0) Agility Test or suffer 2d10 Damage with a Pen of 5),
Adrenal Glands (gaining the Furious Assault Talent), Toxin
Sacs (gaining the Toxic (1d10) Trait on all melee and ranged
attacks, which stacks with the Miasma of the Depths Trait), or
Regeneration (5) (gaining the Regeneration Trait).
<br><b>Tyranid Psyker:</b> The Dagon Overlord is a Tyranid Psyker
and follow the rules for Tyranid Psychic Powers on page 34.
It has access to all the standard Tyranid psychic powers.
<br><b>Death Shock:</b> When the Dagon Overlord is slain, its death
sends a shockwave through the Hive Mind. All Tyranid
creatures that do not have the Fearless Talent or Synapse
creature Trait will automatically break and flee as quickly
as they can (this effect overrides the effects of Instinctive
Behaviour in this instance). Any Tyranid creature with the
Fearless or Synapse Creature Trait must pass a Challenging
(+0) Willpower Test or be stunned for one round.
<br><b>Old Adversary:</b> The Overlord is an ancient Hive Tyrant
and a veteran of countless battles within the Jericho Reach.
Even when it is slain, the Hive Mind resurrects it anew with
memories of its past deeds and a hatred for its foes. The
Dagon Overlord gains the Hatred (Deathwatch) Talent when
facing members of the Deathwatch.
<br><b>Blood of Dagon:</b> When the Overlord leads a swarm of
Tyranid creatures it can spur them on to greater acts of fury
and force them to fight on even when grievously wounded.
Any Horde of Tyranid creatures which fights alongside the
Dagon Overlord benefits from its presence and regenerates
1d5 points of Magnitude at the start of each of its turns.
<br><b>Miasma of the Depths:</b> The Dagon Overlord has a cloud
of toxins constantly oozing from its joints and creates a
virulent haze of haemotoxins, neurotoxins, and deadly
phage organisms all around it much in the same way as a
Venomthrope. It counts as having the Toxic Trait, but the
damage is 2d10, ignoring Toughness and Armour. The
Toughness Test to resist the poison is Very Hard (–30).
<br><b>Body Collector:</b> The Overlord is selective about those it
chooses to devour, and picks only the strongest and most
powerful of its adversaries to consume. Often it will task lesser
Tyranid creatures with gathering together these bodies after,
or even during a battle, and piling them at its feet so it may
feast on them and grow stronger. A Dagon Overlord which
devours the body of a creature with 15 or more wounds and
a Toughness of 40 or more, heals 1d10 points of damage. At
the GM’s discretion, the Overlord may also over time take on
traits of those it devours as it assimilates their flesh."]
