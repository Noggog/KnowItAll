	"content" : "Carnifexes are giant creatures that can be found at the forefront of
Tyranid assaults. These multi-ton monsters act like living battering
rams that can smash through almost any obstacle whether it be
a platoon of men, enemy tanks or a fortified position. They are
specially evolved for use in shock assaults, spaceship boarding actions and massed battles where they can put their overwhelming
strength and preternatural toughness to best effect. A Carnifex is
a living engine of destruction and the attack of just one of these
creatures is a terrifying thing to behold, a primeval force of nature
unleashed in a killing frenzy.<br>
Carnifexes have been encountered in every major encounter
with Tyranids since the arrival of Hive Fleet Behemoth, most
notably at the Battle of Macragge where large numbers of them
were killed during the siege of the polar fortresses. These, the
first Carnifexes to be seen by Imperial forces, became known as
Screamer Killers because of the high-pitched scream they made
as they charged into combat.<br>
The Screamer Killer had four great sickle-shaped claws of
diamond-hard chitin, bone and cartilage. The combined assault
of these mighty scythes driven by the creature’s huge muscle
mass was powerful enough to rip through even armourplas and
ceramite with ease. The source of their high-pitched screaming
was found to be rasping plates in their esophagus that were used
to energize a form of bio-plasma in their gut. This bio-plasma
‘vomit’ made a dangerous short range flamer-like weapon. In some
instances Screamer Killers were reported using an electrical field
around their claws to build up an incandescent bio-plasma ball
before launching it at a target over longer ranges. The Screamer
Killer had a massive body that was found to be extremely tough.
It was also covered with a thick, chitinous hide that protected it
from damage.<br>
The Screamer Killer is now believed to be just one extreme
mutation of the Tyranid warrior genus Tyranicus Tyranicii with a
massively enlarged exoskeleton and musculature. It is accounted
as a stable enough mutation to be given its own classification of
Carnifex Primus. An ever-widening variety of sub-classifications of
Carnifexes developed over the first Tyrannic war and subsequent
attacks by Hive Fleet Kraken and Hive Fleet Leviathan. Over time
it has been discovered that each Hive Fleet, perhaps even each
hive ship, has its own variants on the basic Carnifex.<br>
As with so many of the more extreme warrior mutations,
Carnifexes lose much of the synaptic reception of the Hive
Mind native to Tyranid Warriors and revert to a more animalistic
intelligence level. It should be noted, however, that when this
is mated to their ferocious capacity for violence, even a solitary
Carnifex should not be underestimated. Many reports exist of
lone Carnifexes that turn the tables on their would-be hunters
and terrorize outlying colonies.<br>
All Carnifex species seem well able to adapt to extremes
of environment from arctic cold to desert heat. Their
tremendous strength allows them to plough through swamps
and jungles without hindrance and their endurance seems,
to all intents and purposes, inexhaustible. If Carnifexes
demonstrate one vulnerability, it is possibly that their
bipedal nature and great weight give them a high ground
pressure footprint that can exceed the load bearing strength
of bridges and gantries or break through ice unexpectedly.
Knocking one down is best achieved with an armoured
vehicle but getting one into close proximity with any
Carnifex is a dangerous proposition.<br>
Most Carnifex kills registered come from high energy
attacks—lascannon, plasma and melta weapon strikes to
critical locations. Carnifexes can shrug off other small arms
fire and even bolt gun hits with minimal loss of function. Some great heroes have successfully pitted their speed and agility against a Carnifex to overcome it in close combat, but
many more have died trying.",

<b>Bile-Beast:</b> Remove the Talent Two-weapon wielder (melee).
Add the Traits Spore Cysts†† and Dorsal Chimneys†††. Replace
Scything Talons and Bio-Plasma with Deathspitters (Basic; 40m;

<b>Other Options:</b> At the GM’s Discretion, the Carnifex can lose
the Swift Attack Talent and gain one ranged weapon from the
Tyranid Weapons list in this chapter or from page 373 in the
Deathwatch Rulebook.<br>
<b>††Spore Cysts:</b> Fat spores bloated with vile pathogens
develop in the creature’s carapace before breaking free
and floating away. On any turn the Carnifex can take a
Challenging (+0) Toughness Test as a Free Action to
create a Virus grenade (3D10 I; Pen 0; Blast (2), Toxic) that
drifts 1d5 metres per turn towards the loudest noise in the
vicinity (randomly if indeterminate). If the Toughness Test
is failed, the Carnifex suffers 1d10 damage per degree of
failure with no reduction for Toughness Bonus or armour.<br>
<b>†††Dorsal Chimneys:</b> Non-Tyranid creatures within 60 metres
of a Bile-Beast must pass a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test
each turn or suffer one level of fatigue even if in fully sealed
armour. Characters and NPC’s in unsealed armour take a Hard
(–20) Toughness Test instead. The belching dorsal chimneys
also generate a smoke cloud that covers everything within 15
metres of the Bile-Beast."]
