in operation around the Pyroclast-Gamma-9 facility. These are
huge, hulking brutes, with a vaguely simian form, far more heavily
augmented than most servitor drones, with armoured hydraulic
exoskeletons fused into their once-human flesh and a plethora of
implanted machine-tools. Most are still operating on emergency
orders to defend their assigned posts, asking for the security signal
in a strained guttural voice to any human that approaches and
attacking remorselessly until the intruder is dead or driven away if
the watchword is not spoken within ten seconds. While slow and
not designed for combat, they are nerveless extremely strong and
well-protected, and more than able to obliterate a human being
into a bloody smear with a single blow."
