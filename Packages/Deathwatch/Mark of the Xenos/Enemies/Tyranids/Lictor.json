	"content" : "Lictors are the lone hunters of the Tyranid swarm, roving
ahead of the hive fleet, seeking out prey and leading the
Hive Mind to concentrations of enemies. As tall as a Tyranid
Warrior, Lictors are distinct in appearance from other Tyranid
creatures in a number of ways, such as a pair of long mantislike
claws extending over the creature's shoulders which it can
use for climbing and impaling its prey; long, drooping feeder
tendrils that hang from its maw and greatly increase its senses,
and shimmering chameleonic scales which allow it to hide with
ease. A natural predator, the Lictor is patient and stealthy and
can move past even the most alert foes, or spend days hiding
immobile, waiting for a chance to strike once its prey's guard is
down. This behaviour has given the Lictor an almost mythical
reputation amongst its foes, as a ghost-like horror which can
strike at any time and place, before vanishing into thin air just
as easily.<br>
A Lictor's primary purpose is to lead the Tyranid swarm to
fresh prey and seek out large groups of foes that might be hiding
or fleeing before the swarm. In this role, they move silently
and almost completely invisibly across all kind of terrain, using
their enhanced senses to find their foes. When they locate prey,
they will move in and begin to stalk it, avoiding open conflict
or situations where it might be outnumbered or outmatched
and instead choosing to pick off its targets one by
one. During the course of these attacks,
the Lictor will be exuding a
pheromone trail which other
Tyranid creatures can then
follow to the location of
this fresh prey.<br>
The Lictor also
gathers information for
the Hive Mind. Part of
the creature's unique
genus means that it
is capable of literally
devouring a victim's
memories by eating their
brain, learning more from
them in a single bloody
meal than hours of brutal
interrogation might yield.<br>
Fighting Lictors is very difficult,
as first a solider needs to find one.
Even then, bringing one to battle
can be difficult as they strike and
kill a handful of men before vanishing,
sometimes right before the eyes of
their enemies, and leave no trail to
follow. Lictors are usually only
brought down by quick thinking
heavy weapons teams or powerful
Imperial heroes, such as well-armed Space Marines, which have
the strength and nerve to slay the beast before it can melt away
into the terrain. Another less reliable method of destroying
Lictors, and one favoured by many Imperial Guard commanders,
is the recon by fire method. Once even the slightest evidence of
a Lictor is detected, they will isolate the area they believe it to
be lurking in (sometime kilometres across) and carpet bomb it
into ash and dust. While this only rarely works (Lictors being
cunning enough to either slip away or hide where you least
expect them) it does raise morale among the local soldiers, at
least until the Lictor strikes again...",

		["Special Rules", "<b>Flesh
Hooks:</b> Lictors have dozens of
tiny hooks which they can fire from
their chests to snare prey and drag their
victims toward them. These allow
a Lictor to initiate a Grapple (see
page 240 in the Deathwatch
Rulebook) with a target up to
10m away. With every successful
Opposed Strength Test the Lictor
makes as part of the Grapple action,
the target is pulled closer by 1m plus
1m for each degree of success.
<br><b>Chameleonic
Scales:</b> A Lictor is
covered in chameleonic scales
which shimmer and shift to
match its surroundings and canmake it practically invisible to the naked eye, plus most other
methods of visual detection such as infrared and ultraviolet
scopes. Whenever a Lictor uses its Concealment Skill to
hide, all tests to detect it visually suffer a -30 penalty. In
addition, the scales allow the Lictor to make Concealment
Tests as a Half Action rather than a Full Action and it can
even do so even when being observed or when there is no nearby cover. <br>
<b>Memory Devourer:</b> When a Lictor devours the brain of its
prey, it can learn some of its memories. Once the Lictor has
eaten a brain, it gains access to all of the victim's recent, most
distinct memories (usually the location of friendly troops
or defences). If the Lictor wishes to learn something very
specific from the victim, such as an old memory or one the
victim does not remember well, it must make an Easy (+20) Intelligence Test."]
