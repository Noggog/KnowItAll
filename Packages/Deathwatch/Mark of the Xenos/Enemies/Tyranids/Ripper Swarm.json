	"content" : "One of the most terrifying aspects of a Tyranid hive fleet is the
speed and scale of its operations in stripping a planet. Even
while the Tyranids are overrunning a world’s defences, they are
in the process of rapidly assimilating the genetic imprint and
biomass of every living thing on the planet. Eventually, once
all resistance has been eliminated and everything consumed,
the world will be stripped down to its bedrock, as all of its
moisture, atmosphere and nutrients are absorbed by the hive
ships. By the time the hive fleet moves on, nothing but a lifeless
ball of rock will be left in their wake.<br>
In the initial phases, billions of voracious Tyranid organisms
are released all over the planet. Vast waves of these creatures
move across the surface of the world, constantly multiplying
and consuming everything in their path. The empty deserts left
behind are devoid of even the bones of their former inhabitants,
thanks to the relentless efforts of the ravenous hordes.<br>
Eventually these organisms will be reabsorbed by the Hive
Mind and in some cases evolved to perform higher functions
depending on the genetic material they have absorbed. The
majority become biomass to be rendered down to their base
cells and reshaped by the Norn Queens to fulfill the hive fleet’s
needs. Tyranid-held worlds have been reported to feature
“digestion pools” at the base of impossibly tall capillary towers
that project beyond the atmosphere. Endless streams of Tyranid
creatures have been seen sacrificing themselves in the searing
acids of the pools so that their biomass can be sucked up in to
the hive ships orbiting high above.<br>
These small harvesting organisms are extremely varied but
the most numerous are those known to Adepts as the Tyranicus
Omniphagea, more commonly known to Imperial forces as
Rippers. Rippers have serpentine bodies, around half a metre
long, that terminate in a broad head above a set of vestigial
gripping claws. The head is split by a wide maw filled with
rows of exceedingly sharp ripping hooks and razor-edged
boney ridges. The Ripper’s powerful jaws can bite through
flesh and bone with alarming ease, and they have been known
to gnaw their way through plasteel to reach food.<br>
Rippers are energetic and fearless organisms, quite capable
of pulling down creatures many times their own size, from a
rampaging Grox to an armed man. Huge swarms of Rippers
are often seen on the battlefield, advancing behind Tyranid
assault forces. These gorge themselves on the fallen, tearing
apart the wounded and cannibalising the dead. It might appear
that an armoured Space Marine would be safe from the attacks
of individual Rippers, but en masse they can immobilise and
drag down even the strongest Battle-Brother.<br>
In certain instances, hive ships have been driven away
from a world, leaving Tyranid ground forces isolated. Rippers
appear to respond to such circumstances by burrowing below
ground and metamorphosing into higher life forms. This has
led many among the Magos Biologis to believe that Rippers
are an immature form of the prime Tyrancii genus. This would
mean they are theoretically capable of gestating into any kind
of Tyranid creature with the right impetus from the Hive Mind,
from Hive Tyrants to Hormagaunts. The wonder that Tyranids
routinely produce and sacrifice their young so prodigiously
serves only to reinforce how inhuman they truly are.",

<b>Horde:</b> Rippers can be used as a Horde (see the Horde rules on
page 359 of the Deathwatch Rulebook). While in a Horde,
Rippers gain the Rampage, Relentless, and Overwhelming
Traits, the Swift Attack Talent, and their attacks gain the
Tearing quality. A Horde of Rippers has the Fear 1 (Disturbing)
Trait. Alter the Size Trait as appropriate for Horde magnitude.
<br><b>Biomorphs:</b> At the GM’s discretion, Rippers may be given
any of the following Traits:<br>
• Toxic (1d10)<br>
• Flyer (3)<br>
• Unnatural Toughness (x2)<br>
<b>Spinespitter:</b> +30 BS and gain ranged weapon (Pistol;
20m; –/3/–; 1d10+1 I; Pen 0; Clip —; Rld —; Living
Ammunition).<br>
<b>Tenacious Grappler:</b> Rippers drag down their prey by
grappling with it so that others can latch on more easily.
When attempting to grapple an opponent armed with a
melee weapon, Rippers suffer a –10 to their WS instead of
the normal –20."]
