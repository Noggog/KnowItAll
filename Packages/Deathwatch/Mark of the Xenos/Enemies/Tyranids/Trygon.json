	"content" : "The largest Tyranid creatures can become hard to accurately
categorise as they increasingly appear as strange aggregations
of symbiotes and parasites on a colossal scale. This is not the
case with the Tyranid Trygon however, a distinct genus of vast
serpentine creatures that tower above even the mighty Carnifex.
Adepts have postulated a link between the Trygon and the
smaller but equally ophidian Ravener, but it remains unclear
whether Trygons are massively mutated Raveners or Raveners
are underdeveloped, perhaps even immature, Trygons. Certainly
adult Trygons can reach truly monstrous proportions, with
examples of up to thirty metres in length on record, although
twelve to fifteen metres is more common.<br>
Trygons are extremely heavily armoured by a coat of
overlapping scales that covers them from jaws to tail. In addition
to offering excellent protection, these specialised scales form
an essential part of the Trygon's natural weaponry. The thick
armour plates include high concentrations of silicates and as the
Trygon moves they become agitated, generating a powerful biostatic
charge that is captured by subdermal platelet stacks. The
Trygon directs this energy by exhaling an ionised spray from its
gills, to prompt a deadly, high-voltage discharge.<br>
Trygons have two sets of diamond-hard scything talons folded
beneath their hood-like carapace that they use with lethal effect in
close combat. Driven by a Trygon's size and strength, these wicked
blades can easily impale an armoured vehicle or cut an armoured
man in two. However, the primary purpose of the Trygon's claws is
to allow it to burrow though practically any material at a terrifying
rate. These creatures have shown themselves capable of detecting
an enemy from below and seem to have a singular fondness
for bursting out of the ground beneath them with shocking
suddenness. Tanks and troops surprised in this way seldom have
a chance to reply to the barrage of sweeping claw strikes and biostatic
lightning unleashed upon them.<br>
Seismic detectors have been used with some success to provide
early warning of a Trygon's approach. Unfortunately, on many
worlds, natural seismic activity can mask a Trygon's motion and
in some instances Tyranid swarm activity seems to have been
deliberately coordinated to cover the approach of burrowing
Trygons. Trygons have forced tunnels through just about every
material known to man, although they are considerably slowed
by adamantium plating.<br>
It appears that Trygons use their bio-static charge to assist with
tunnelling, as their tunnels have been found coated with a fused,
glass-like silicate layer on the inside. This effect stabilises the tunnel
walls and prevents them from collapsing behind a burrowing
Trygon. Other Tyranid organisms will take advantage of these
tunnels to move around unseen and follow up on Trygon attacks.
The emergence of a burrowing Trygon is often just the harbinger
of a tidal wave of nightmarish horrors.<br>
Commanders have found static defences become virtually
useless once Trygons are operating in the area, unless tunnel
torpedoes or mole mortars can be brought to bear to keep
them at bay. Over an extended period, Tyrgons are capable of
excavating a network of underground tunnels covering a huge
area, which makes it difficult to wipe out Tyranid forces even
with saturation bombardment. Clearing out Trygon sub-surface
tunnel networks is dangerous work even for a Deathwatch Killteam
and is a duty given only to the most experienced and wellequipped
Battle-Brothers.<br>
Trygons have also been known to dig deadfall traps by
leaving a thin crust over a deep conical hole. Sufficient weight
in troops and armour will collapse the roof of the sinkhole and
deposit the victims into the Trygon's waiting claws. A Trygon's
greatest weakness is probably that it can be baited or misdirected
while burrowing by the first tasty morsel to cross its path. Under
the direction of the Hive Mind, a Trygon becomes even more
dangerous, as it will tunnel deep into the heart of the defences
before bursting forth.<br>
Unfortunately, a mutation now dubbed the Trygon Prime
has been confirmed, that appears to have the relevant synapse
development to make it a conduit for the influence of the Hive
Mind. A Trygon Prime can be easily spotted by their elongated
jaws and the containment spines running the length of their
bodies. These are extended platelet stacks that enable the Trygon
Prime to store up even greater charges of bio-electricity. A Trygon
Prime is swathed in sheets of lightning whenever it moves, and
when it opens its jaws, searing arcs of energy leap forth that
leave only charred corpses in their wake. The strong synaptic
link a Trygon Prime shares with the Hive Mind allows it to
dominate lesser Tyranid creatures, including other Trygons, and
it will rarely be found without an attendant horde of Termagants
and Hormagaunts.",
