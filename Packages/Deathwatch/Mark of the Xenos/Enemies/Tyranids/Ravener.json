	"content" : "Raveners are horrific predators that burrow through the
earth with frightening speed and precision. They are twisted,
serpentine creatures whose armoured bodies are several times
the size of a grown man’s, and yet they move with a lightninglike
speed that can see their victims slashed apart into bloody
chunks, having never seen their assailant. Vulnerable only to
massed firepower and heavy weapons, the Ravener’s prey
stands little chance if caught alone or off guard, as they often
exploit their ability to burrow through almost any substance
to surprise their victims, sensing their way by vibrations as
faint as a beating heart, through many metres of intervening
material. Often Raveners strike deep behind a battle line or
in strongholds thought impregnable to outside assault, and
worse yet for those that must face them; Raveners rarely hunt
alone, but are instead often encountered in broods of half a
dozen or more creatures. In several recorded cases, when such a
brood breaks in to a shelter or underground bunker, they have
inflicted utter carnage in minutes, ending the lives of hundreds
in a few scant moments of screaming, blood-soaked fury.<br>
While Raveners do appear similar in size and basic design
to Tyranid Warriors, with the major exception being their
serpentine tail rather than legs, they are in fact very different
beasts and bred for a very different purpose. Possessed of little
more than animal intelligence, unless directed
by the Hive Mind they will wilfully chase
fleeing prey or become distracted by
fast moving targets disregarding all
other concerns. The role of a hunting
beast however is one they excel at,
and they possess extraordinary
senses for tracking foes, able
to feel the slightest tremor
made by passing footfalls
even kilometres away and
see into dozens of light
spectrums, even following
the pulsing waves of a vox
transmission to its source.
This makes it very hard to hide from a
Ravener, and it is especially dangerous if
being directed by the Hive Mind
and its senses used to guide the
bulk of the swarm toward the
location of its prey.<br>
Perhaps the most
disconcerting aspect of the
serpentine Raveners is their
ability to appear in almost any
location and usually where
their foes least expect them.
By burrowing through even
some of the hardest substances, they can worm their way into
heavily fortified structures, squeezing through opening much
smaller than themselves and slinking off to hide in dark places
to await the time to strike. This known tactic of the Ravener
often prompts Imperial commanders to send their men on patrol
looking for Ravener “nid holes” which might be hidden in
subterranean tunnels or deep cellars. Needless to say, should an
Imperial Guard patrol find such a “nid hole,” more often than not
it is their dying screams which alert their comrades.",
