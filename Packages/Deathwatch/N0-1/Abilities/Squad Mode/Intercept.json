	"content" : "Swooping Hawks are perhaps the swiftest
of Aspect Warriors, capable of crossing great distances
quickly to attack, able even to intercept the advance of
swift-moving enemy vehicles like Land Speeders. When
the Exarch activates this ability, all Swooping Hawks in
his squad may make an immediate Charge Move and
then either fire their Grenade Pack or throw a grenade.
<br><br><b>Improvements:</b> If the Exarch spends an additional
point of Cohesion to activate this Attack Pattern, then
the squad adds +20 to their rolls to hit with the grenades
and grenade packs.",
