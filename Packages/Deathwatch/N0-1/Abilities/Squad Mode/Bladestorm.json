	"content" : "Dire Avengers are masters of their weaponry,
and at the direction of so deadly a warrior as an
Exarch, can turn this mastery into a finely coordinated
onslaught that few can withstand. When the Exarch calls a
Bladestorm, both he and those in support range may make
an immediate Double Move and a Full-Auto Burst attack
with an Avenger Shuriken Catapult or Shuriken Pistol.
<br>
<br><b>Improvements:</b> If the Exarch spends an additional
point of Cohesion to activate this Attack Pattern, then all
the Shuriken weaponry used during this attack gain either
the Storm or Razor-Sharp quality for this attack only. The
same choice applies to all affected weapons.",
