	"content" : "The Exarch?s keen eye and carefully-honed
skill allow him to find the weaknesses in any armour or
fortification in an instant, and within seconds, this insight
is spread to his squad, whose attacks are all the deadlier
for it. The Exarch nominates a single enemy vehicle or
fortification he can see. Until that target is destroyed, the
squad gains a bonus to their Pen values equal to the Exarch?
s Perception Bonus against that target.
<br><br><b>Improvements:</b> If the Exarch spends an additional
point of Cohesion to activate this Attack Pattern, then any
Fusion Gun fired by a member of the squad (including the
Exarch?s Fire Pike, if he has one) gain an additional +1d10
of damage against the chosen target if their attack roll
succeeds by two or more Degrees of Success.",
