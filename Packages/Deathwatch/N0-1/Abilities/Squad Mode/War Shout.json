carefully-designed war-cries that are intended to take advantage
of their Banshee Masks and more effectively disable
their foes. The Exarch activates this ability during a
Charge Attack, leading her students in a song of desolation
and doom that leaves enemies incapacitated and vulnerable.
Until the start of the Exarch?s next turn, any creature
affected by the squad?s Banshee Masks is rendered
Helpless for one round, instead of Stunned.",
