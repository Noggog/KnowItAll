	"content" : "The Howling Banshees are amongst the
most agile and acrobatic of Aspect Warriors, moving at
bewildering speed towards and amongst their enemies.
With intense training from their Exarchs, this speed and
agility can be honed even further, allowing them to move
seamlessly from the fury of combat even as they avoid the
clumsily-swung blades of the young races. Whilst this
Defensive Stance is in effect, any member of the squad
who successfully passes a Dodge Test in melee may move
up to her normal Half Move rate away from the attacker.
Each Howling Banshee may only do this once per round.",
