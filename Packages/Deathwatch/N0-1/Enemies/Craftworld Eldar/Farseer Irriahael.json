	"content" : "Like many Farseers, Irriahael seldom takes to the battlefield unless the situation is dire and requires immediate
and detailed oversight. His powers are fearsome, allowing him to direct the flow of battle in the same way a composer
directs an orchestra, subtly altering fate and chance so as to ensure victory. Under his prophetic direction, Eldar warriors
become deadlier and swifter, able to slay their foes and escape as if little more than murderous spectres.
<br><br><b>Usage:</b> Irriahael is a typical Farseer in many ways, and the powers he manifests serve his role well. Rather than
being a powerhouse in his own right, he serves as a force multiplier for the warriors under his command, maintaining
many powers simultaneously to combine their potent effects. If attended by a group of Warlocks with
Augment, his powers grow further still, increasing his influence over the battle. Irriahael is possibly the most fragile
Master-level adversary around, lacking the thick armour, high toughness and copious amounts of wounds possessed
by Hive Tyrants, Tau Commanders, Ork Warlords and Daemon Princes. However, his psychic prowess
and the potency of his Rune Armour allow him to ignore most of the harm sent his way, as does his ability to
Dodge attacks.",

<br><br><b>Psychic Powers (Psy Rating 8):</b> Farseer Irriahael knows all the powers from the Divination and Telepathy Disciplines,
and four unique Farseer Powers described below. Note that, as Farseer Irriahael has Unnatural Willpower (x2), he gains a
bonus +2 to his Psy Rating, added after determining the Power Level of a power."],

		<b>Ghosthelm:</b> The exotic construction and complex runes of this tall helm serve to protect the wearer from the
dangers of the Immaterium. If ever the Ghosthelm's wearer is affected by Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp
(whether or not he caused them), he may attempt a Challenging (+0) Willpower Test. If he succeeds, then he is completely
unaffected by the Psychic Phenomena/Perils of the Warp, though others nearby may still suffer those effects.<br>
<b>Rune Armour:</b> The typical raiment of Eldar Seers in battle are layers of voluminous robes adorned with faintly-luminescent
runes and lattices of wraithbone that flicker and pulse in time with the wearer's heartbeat. When the weapons
of the enemy are turned upon him, the Seer's mind and soul are stronger than any corporeal armour, able to repel
even the ravening energies of a Lascannon. Rune Armour is a Force Field with a Protection Rating equal to the wearer's Willpower Characteristic. There is no chance of Rune Armour overloading."],

		["Equipment", "3x Shuriken Pistol magazines, Spirit Stones, Runes of Warding, Runes of Witnessing
<br><br><b>Runes of Warding:</b> These trinkets and talismen flicker with a ghostly luminescence, turning aside the energies of the Immaterium when they are brought to bear against the Farseer or
his allies. All non-Eldar psykers within 50m of the Farseer count their Psy Rating, after determining Power Level, as two lower, and must add +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena and Perils
of the Warp tables.
<br><br><b>Runes of Witnessing:</b> Often seen hanging in the air around a powerful Eldar Seer, these runes store and
diffuse the power of the Warp so that it cannot so easily go out of control. Runes of Witnessing are considered to
be a Psy Focus, and reduce all rolls the Farseer makes on the Psychic Phenomena and Perils of the Warp tables by
–10.
<br><br><b>Spirit Stones:</b> Similar to the Soulstones worn by all Craftworld and Exodite Eldar, Spirit Stones contain
the waking essence of long-dead Eldar Seers, who aid and support their living kin in times of need. Once in every
24 hour period, the Farseer may use a second Psychic Power during his turn, taking a Free Action for the Focus
Power Test. In addition, the Farseer requires only a Free Action each turn to sustain on-going Psychic Powers.
