	"content" : "Named for the creature of Eldar myth that could draw the souls from mortals with its hellish shriek, Howling Banshees
represent the inescapable nature of death, and strive to bring swift oblivion to the enemies of the Eldar. For many who would
oppose the Children of Isha, the last thing they ever hear is the terrible psychic wail of the Howling Banshees as they charge,
rendering them senseless in the moments before they die.
<br><br>
<b>Usage:</b> Howling Banshees are potent shock troops, their Banshee Masks and power weapons allowing them to overpower most
adversaries, and their agility and acrobatic nature allowing them to easily disengage and withdraw should the fighting threaten
to bog them down. Howling Banshees operate best in small groups, attempting to disable several opponents quickly to avoid
being trapped and overwhelmed by enemy reprisals.",

<b>Banshee Mask:</b> The signature wargear of the Howling Banshee Aspect, the Banshee Mask is a helm capable of amplifying
a warrior?s war-cries into a powerful psycho-sonic shriek that overloads their victims? nervous systems, leaving them incapable
of defending themselves for a few moments – just long enough for the Banshees to strike. When a Howling Banshee performs
a Charge Attack action, the target of that charge must attempt a Hard (–20) Willpower Test or be Stunned for 1 round.
