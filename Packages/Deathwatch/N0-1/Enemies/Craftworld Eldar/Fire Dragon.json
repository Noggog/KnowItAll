	"content" : "Representing Khaine's aspect as the destroyer, Fire Dragons prove that not even the toughest armour or the strongest fortifications
are proof against the ire of the Eldar. Destruction and desolation are the gifts of the Fire Dragon, and there is little that
can withstand their onslaught.
<br>
<br>
<b>Usage:</b> Fire Dragons specialise in breaking open hard targets such as battle tanks and fortified bunkers, though their powerful
Fusion Guns also serve them well against heavy infantry such as Astartes Terminators and Tau Crisis Battlesuits. Their effectiveness
in such a role is considerable, with a few Fire Dragons easily able to overcome extraordinarily tough adversaries in a relatively
short space of time thanks to the variety of tools at their disposal. In particular, their Evaluate skill allows them to cut
through static defences in almost no time at all",
