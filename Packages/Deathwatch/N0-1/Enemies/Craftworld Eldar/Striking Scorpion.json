	"content" : "Striking Scorpions embody the notion of concealed strength, of potency held in check and unnoticed until the moment it
is used. To this end, they are powerful melee combatants with considerable skill at remaining undetected, striking from their
hidden positions with swift and startling fury. The disorienting blast of plasma grenades and Mandiblaster fire is the herald of
their assault, followed by the whispered growl of their impossibly sharp chain-blades.
<br>
<br>
<b>Usage:</b> Striking Scorpions are skilled melee combatants who excel at surprise attacks and ambushes, using dense terrain to cover their advance and tools like plasma grenades and their Mandiblaster
Helms to disrupt enemy forces and sow confusion as they launch their attack. As with other Aspect Warriors, Striking Scorpions work best in small coordinated groups, using speed and
stealth to attack suddenly and without warning.",

<br><b>Mandiblaster Helm:</b> The signature weapon of the Striking Scorpions are devices known as Mandible Blasters, or Mandiblasters,
mounted in pods on either side of the warrior?s helm, designed to fire at a mental impulse. Extremely short-ranged,
Mandiblasters are employed as the Striking Scorpions charge, firing moments before the first blow is struck and spitting tiny
metal slivers at the target. These slivers are inconsequential on their own, but fractions of a second later, they are turned into
white-hot bursts of plasma as they are struck by the high-powered lasers that form the weapons? second stage. A Striking Scorpion
can incapacitate, kill or disorient his enemy with a well-placed shot. When performing a Charge Attack action, a Striking
Scorpion may fire his Mandiblaster Helm before he makes any attacks, rolling to hit as if using a ranged weapon at Short Range.
Once hits from a Mandiblaster Helm have been resolved, the Striking Scorpion may continue to make his melee attack as normal."],
