	"content" : "The first and most common form of Aspect Warrior, Dire Avengers are extremely skilled combatants, easily a match for
the Astartes in terms of combat prowess, and while not as strong or resilient as the Emperor's Finest, they are far swifter and
more agile. Their principle weapon is an exotic form of Shuriken Catapult, more deadly than those carried by Guardians and
fitted with an array of targeting devices. Dire Avengers are valued for their tactical flexibility, swiftly adapting their approach as
the situation changes with a combat awareness that seems almost supernatural.",

<b>Usage:</b> Dire Avengers are in many ways the archetypal Eldar warrior – swift on offence, difficult to pin down, and capable of
unleashing a hail of startlingly precise fire at a moment?s notice. Their light armour and low toughness make them fragile warriors,
particularly as Elites, but their ability to avoid harm and cross distances quickly allows them a considerable amount of control
over when and where a fight occurs. Dire Avengers are best used in small groups, with individuals cooperating closely to
achieve their goals.
