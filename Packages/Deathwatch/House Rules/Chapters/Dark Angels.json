<h2>Background</h2>
The Dark Angels stand first amongst the Space Marine
Chapters, as they have done since their very inception.
Theirs is a proud Chapter, with traditions and rituals
that date back to the earliest days of the Imperium. The origins
of the Dark Angels Chapter are shrouded in mystery, however.
Few records of its beginnings exist, nor are there many
mentions of the part it played in the Emperor’s Great Crusade.
Most references in the histories of the Imperium to its deeds
during the accursed times of the Horus Heresy have been
expunged. But yet, a legend persists that at one point the Dark
Angels teetered on the very brink of heresy and that an act
of the most terrible betrayal dishonoured all of the Chapter’s
feats of valour, leaving an enduring stain upon the Chapter’s
honour. Such is their shame that from that time onwards, the
Dark Angels have borne the mark of the Unforgiven and must
strive for absolution from the sins of millennia past.<br>
Their terrible secret is that during the Horus Heresy, some of
the brethren were turned to the side of Chaos. The renegades
were defeated in a battle that destroyed the Dark Angels’ home
world, Caliban, but many of the traitor Dark Angels survived
to be cast through space and time by the intervention of the
Chaos Gods. These survivors are known
to those few Dark Angels granted
nowledge of their existence
as The Fallen. In the eyes of
the Chapter’s leaders, there is
only one way that the Chapter
can ever atone for its shame,
restoring its honour and trust in
the eyes of the Emperor: that is,
if all of the Fallen are found and
either made to repent, or slain.<br>
The story of treachery and
betrayal is the Dark Angels’ hidden
shame, and their secret mission to
destroy all of the Fallen is
now their only hope of
salvation. No one knows
of this other than the Dark
Angels, their successor
Chapters and, perhaps, the
Emperor himself on his
Golden Throne.<br>
The Chapter has been
shaped by its dark past and
is secretive and monastic
in nature, with much time
given over to worship and
prayer. There are many
different levels within the Chapter which individuals may
gradually rise through. On attaining each new level, they are
granted a little more knowledge of the truth behind the Dark
Angels’ origins, but only the highest-ranking members of the
Chapter know the terrible, shameful secret of what occurred
ten thousand years ago.
<br><br>
<h3>Caliban</h3> 
Caliban, the home world of the Dark Angels, was once a
verdant world of dense forests. Yet, those forests seethed
with mutation and corruption, the baleful influence of the
nearby Eye of Terror cursing Caliban and making it one of
the deadliest worlds in the galaxy. The original inhabitants
of Caliban are said to have been a proud, martial people,
brought up to live and die by the sword. The lush forests
were inhabited by all manner of terrifying beasts that had
been warped by Chaos. The ferocity of these creatures forced
the inhabitants to build brooding stone fortresses in huge
clearings hacked from the forests, in which the warrior-elite
dwelled. It was from this ruling class, called the Order, that
the Dark Angels Legion was formed.<br>
During the titanic wars of the Horus Heresy, the entire
planet of Caliban was torn asunder, reduced in a cataclysmic
battle to scattered debris. All that remained was the rock upon
which stood the ruins of the Order’s fortress monastery. In the
millennia since the destruction of Caliban, the Dark Angels
have drilled deep into the bedrock and rebuilt the fortress
ruins. The dead asteroid was transformed into the Dark
Angels home, called the Rock, while the rebuilt monastery
is referred to as the Tower of Angels. Countless tunnels, halls
and chambers were constructed and, in time, even warp
engines were fitted to allow the Rock to move from star
to star. As a result, the Rock does not stay in any
one place for any length of time, and the Chapter
recruits from a variety of different worlds.<br>
Many dark secrets lie
deep within the Tower
of Angels. Dungeons
that have remained sealed
for centuries and secret
caves shut behind
adamantium doors
and bound with
holy sigils conceal
vast repositories of
ancient archeotech.
Only the most senior of the Dark
Angels, the Masters and the Inner
Circle, are aware of the chambers
and may unlock their dread secrets.
<br><br>
<h3>The Inner Circle</h3> 
After the fall of Caliban, the senior members
of the Legion assembled in secret conclave. They
decreed that knowledge of the fall of their brothers must
remain undisclosed for all time, that no outsider must ever
learn of the schism that had split the legion or that someSpace Marines of the Dark Angels Legion had turned to the
Ruinous Powers. Should this dreadful truth ever become
known, they feared, the Dark Angels would be reviled as
traitors, and all hope of expunging the stain to their honour
would be lost forever. An Inner Circle of the Legion’s most
senior officers was formed to forever guard this dangerous
knowledge, and each member swore oaths of unspeakable
binding.<br>
The Grand Masters of the Inner Circle swore that so
long as even one of the traitor Fallen remained alive and
unrepentant, the Dark Angels would be Unforgiven, cursed
by their own brothers to atone for all eternity for the sins of
the past. Until every last Fallen Dark Angel was captured and
made to repent, there could be no peace for the true sons of
the Lion. This would be the true mission of the Inner Circle,
and, through its machinations, that of the entire Chapter.<br>
The Inner Circle passed on their terrible knowledge only
sparingly. The truth of what occurred on Caliban is withheld
from new recruits, and only told to the Battle-Brothers one
passage at a time. Much of the Dark Angels’ teachings to
their brethren are couched in allegory and myth, the same
essential truths told and retold, in one form after another. The
first such allegory a Dark Angel is told recounts the so-called
Tale of Two-Heads-Talking, in which a band of Deathwing
Terminators returned to the planet of their birth to find
their people enslaved by hideous xenos overlords. Daubing
their armour white, as was the tradition of their people, the
Terminators began their death-quest. They defeated their
enemy, but at the cost of the life of their beloved librarian.
Similar tales are told at every stage in a Dark Angel’s
progression through the ranks, the details changing from
one story to the next, but the essential truth remaining. Each
tells of a group of heroes returning to their home world to
find their people enthralled by a traitor, and only at the cost
of eternal shame are the enemies defeated. Even then, some
always escape.<br>
Only on his ascension to the First Company, called the
Deathwing, does a Battle-Brother begin to learn the truth
of the events that transpired at the very dawn of the Age of
the Imperium. Rising through the intricate and convoluted
ranks of the Inner Circle, he learns more and more, the secrets
one by one unveiled as his masters’ trust in him increases.<br>
Only upon ascension to the rank of Grand Master is the
truth revealed, and even then, it is likely that there remain
revelations known only to the holder of the title of Supreme
Grand Master, the Chapter Master of the Dark Angels.
Only the most trusted of brethren are considered for
membership of the Inner Circle. These Space Marines are
observed from afar, and it may be many decades before
they are finally approached. Only warriors who have fought
through the ranks for many years and have proved their
loyalty to the Chapter time and time again are allowed to
progress. Silent and hooded brothers lead them before the
Inner Circle for judgement, and soon after they are elevated
to the Deathwing—or else they disappear forever.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3> 
With the breakup of the Space Marine Legions after the Horus
Heresy, the Dark Angels were split into Chapters according
to Roboute Guilliman’s Codex Astartes. With the exception
of the Deathwing and the Ravenwing, the Dark Angels
follow standard Space Marine combat doctrine, and their
dogged resistance against overwhelming odds is legendary. In
situations where even other Space Marines might withdraw
and redeploy, the Dark Angels will fight to the bitter end
rather than give ground to their foes. This is also reflected in
their stubborn refusal to move in the face of the enemy, even
in situations where it would sometimes be tactically beneficial
for them to do so.",

Although only the upper echelons of the Chapter are aware of the awful truth of the Dark Angels’ past, even those newly
recruited are possessed of a secretive, even introverted nature. The idea that outsiders are not to be trusted is drilled into
the recruits from an early stage, and they are tested continuously to ensure their compliance until it becomes second nature.
After all, a brother who cannot be entirely trusted to keep the Chapter’s secrets is unlikely to advance through its ranks.<br>
Although the Dark Angels have fought beside all of the branches of the Imperium’s vast military machine, they prefer
to stand beside other Space Marines. Many, even brother Astartes, find the Dark Angels aloof and uncommunicative. The
Dark Angels, for their part are impatient and unforgiving with strangers who pry into their affairs. In truth, those Dark
Angels who are aware of the existence of the Fallen are ever watchful for any sign of their activity, and will abandon
whatever mission they are about should they gain any clue that one is nearby. In theory, even a Dark Angel seconded to
the Deathwatch could go “off mission” in this manner, although the annals of Watch Fortress Erioch do not relate any such
incident taking place.<br>
The Dark Angels are also notoriously intolerant of non-humans and will often refuse to fight alongside armies that
include abhuman warriors or alien races. They are highly suspicious of outsiders and often appear unreasonably aloof and
intransigent. Indeed, there have been a number of occasions where Dark Angels have withdrawn suddenly and with no
explanation from a warzone when confronted by an Inquisitor or missionary.<br>
Despite such incidents, many Dark Angels have served with distinction and honour in the Deathwatch. Their taciturn
nature and stubborn refusal to accept anything other than total victory over their foes has served the Deathwatch well, and
several noted Watch Commanders are drawn from the Chapter. These keep in close contact with one another, coordinating
the efforts of the Deathwatch across entire sectors of the Imperium."],

The Dark Angels have a shadowy past hidden by the weight
of history and shrouded in the smoke and blood of the Horus
Heresy itself. Few outside the Chapter can even guess at the
exact facts surrounding the Chapter’s beginning, and those
within its ranks guard their secrets well. Such weighty secrets
can come to press heavily on a Battle-Brother’s soul.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Dark Dreams):</b> The Battle-Brother is beset with
memories of past times and deep, hidden secrets that cast a
shadow over periods of rest and meditation. At the start of
any mission, the Battle-Brother must pass a Challenging
(+0) Toughness Test or begin play with a level of Fatigue.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Scorn of Outsiders):</b> The Dark Angel has
grown to view those outside the Chapter as misguided or
ignorant of the truth and cannot bring himself to deal with
them any more than necessary. The Battle-Brother cannot use
the Command Skill on anyone who is not either a member of
his Kill-team or a fellow Dark Angel.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Deep Suspicions):</b> Trained in an atmosphere
of silence and secrets, the Dark Angel has become very
distrustful of anyone outside his Chapter and cannot take the
words or promises of others at face value. Unless the Battle-
Brother’s Kill-team is solely comprised of Dark Angels, its
Cohesion is reduced by 2."],
