<h2>Background</h2>
The Imperial Fists are one of the First Founding Chapters,
and as such their traditions and doctrines are shaped by ten
thousand years and more of service to the Imperium. A character
drawn from the Imperial and doctrines, and a proud the Space Marine Primarchs. an Imperial Fists character has the opportunity to roleplay a
Battle-Brother with a unique disposition. The Imperial Fists
are masters of all they turn their hand to, but they have never
entirely shaken off the guilt that their Primarch took upon
himself when he was unable between the Emperor and Fists test themselves constantly, redemption for a crime redeemed countless times the millennia. Their selfl devotion to duty is once the Imperial Fists’
greatest strength, and their
singular flaw.
<br><br>
<h3>The Emperor's Praetorians</h3> 
The Imperial Fists are second only to the noble
Ultramarines in the honours they have earned
through their dedication to the Imperium
and to Humanity. Since before the dawn of
the Age of Imperium, the Imperial Fists have
stood resolute against any and every threat,
standing firm where others have given ground
and frequently making the ultimate
sacrifice in the name of and duty. The steadfastness,
stoicism and selfl essness the Imperial Fists is legendary,
and the Chapter’s Primarch,
the mighty Rogal Dorn, is a figure
of adoration the length and breadth of the
Domains of Man.
<br><br>
<h3>By Duty Bound</h3> 
The history of the Imperial Fists Chapter is one of total
dedication to the Emperor, stretching back to the glorious days
of the Great Crusade in which the Emperor led his legions
from ancient Terra and unifi ed the disparate worlds of man
under his rule. The Imperial Fists served throughout that age as
the Emperor’s praetorians, forming a strategic reserve that their
master could call upon when other forces wavered. Countless
worlds were captured, and a myriad of foes defeated by the
timely deployment of the 7th Legion, and numerous enemy
counter-attacks turned by its heroic interventions. Through
their prosecution of hundreds of campaigns of liberation, the
legion’s warriors became the masters of both facets of siege
warfare: in defence they were immovable, and in attack they
were unstoppable, their measured, artful application of military
principles combining with their utterly selfl ess dedication to
their master and his cause earning them their special place at
the Emperor’s side.<br>
While Roboute Guiliman, Primarch of the Ultramarines
Legion, rebuilt the Imperium and the Space Marines according
to the doctrines of his Codex Astartes, Dorn crusaded amongst
the stars. Many of the Imperial Fists railed against the dictates
of the codex, unwilling to divide their Legion into Chapters
and regarding the entire notion as a slur on their honour, for
had the Imperial Fists not proved their loyalty and devotion a
thousand times over?<br>
Dorn’s penance was fi nally ended in climactic fashion at
the battle known as the Iron Cage. Driven almost beyond
reason by the taunts of his rival, the traitor Primarch of the
Iron Warriors Legion, Dorn plunged himself into what would
prove his, and his Legion’s, ultimate crucible. The Iron Cage
was an entire world of fi endishly devised fortifi cations, which
their creator had claimed none, not even Dorn, could crack.
The Imperial Fists went into the Iron Cage consumed by their
perceived failure, but they emerged victorious, for they were
prepared to fi ght to the death for their cause, while the Iron
Warriors were not. It was only when Guiliman despatched the
Ultramarines to put an end to the bitter struggle that Dorn saw
the light, and took his place beside his brother Primarchs. He
accepted the new order, and ordered his Legion broken up into
Chapters according to his brother Primarch’s wisdom.<br>
Many of the more zealous, crusade-minded Battle-Brothers
of the old Legion became the Black Templars Chapter,
continuing the crusade their Primarch had begun in the
aftermath of the Heresy. These had scant regard for the Codex
Astartes, and took to the stars to follow their own destiny.
The newest Battle-Brothers, who were perhaps less set in their
ways, became the Crimson Fists Chapter, and readily embraced
the doctrines of the codex. The remainder became the Imperial
Fists Chapter, the true sons and inheritors of Rogal Dorn, and
they have served at the very forefront of the Imperium’s wars
for ten thousand years, maintaining the values instilled in them
by their Primarch: duty, honour, truth, and sacrifice.
<br><br>
<h3>Heritors of Dorn</h3> 
Even before their division into Chapters, the Imperial Fists
never laid claim to a single home world. Instead, they are
a space-borne Chapter, and their home is an ancient and
unique vessel called Phalanx. As large as a moon and capable
of docking over a dozen cruisers, Phalanx is a marvel of the
starshipwright’s craft that predates the Imperium, the secrets of its construction lost in the long millennia since the Dark
Age of Technology. During the Great Crusade, the coming
of Phalanx was a portent of glory, for it shone so bright it
appeared to the benighted souls of lost worlds that a new star
glittered in their heavens. The Emperor himself called Phalanx
his fl agship during many campaigns, .and the Imperial Fists
know that he once trod the ancient and worn deck plates they
themselves walk every day.<br>
Being a space-borne Chapter, the Imperial Fists recruit
from a variety of worlds. The Chapter maintains a great
number of Fortress-Chapels on worlds across the Imperium.
Such places are staffed by small, dedicated cadres of veterans,
perhaps warriors wounded so grievously they can no longer
fi ght, but still well able to serve their Chapter. The staff of
these facilities keep a watch upon the peoples around them,
seeking potential candidates for recruitment. On some worlds
they hold tournaments and contests to ascertain suitability,
while on others they actually instigate combat in order to
test potential recruits in person. On some Hive Worlds,
the Imperial Fists conduct purges of the down-hive slums,
ostensibly to clear out undesirable elements on behalf of the
planetary government, but they often return with captives
they have judged such worthy fi ghters they will be invited
to undertake the trials. The Imperial Fists are unusual in
making few, if any, demands of the peoples of the worlds
they recruit from, other than the right to test those who
believe themselves worthy of entering the ranks of the Battle-
Brothers. Whatever the source of the recruit, whether he
comes from a brotherhood of warrior-knights or a band of
hive-gang psychopaths, the Chapter instils its noble doctrines
in him, retaining his essential martial qualities but overlaying
them with the qualities that the Imperial Fists have inherited
from their Primarch and their ancestors. The Chapter is not
especially shaped by the mores and character of the worlds
its warriors are drawn form, and instead draws heavily on its
own traditions and the values instilled in it by its Primarch.<br>
One of these traditions is thought to date back to the
earliest days of the old Legion, before it even left Terra on the
Great Crusade. The Imperial Fists engage in ceaseless duels
against one another, sometimes to settle a point of honour
but more often to test themselves and their swordsmanship.
The most experienced and long-serving Imperial Fists sport
numerous duelling scars all over their bodies, each a reminder
of a hard-won victory, or a salutary defeat.<br>
Another tradition that the Imperial Fists engage in is the
practice of scrimshawing the bones of their fallen Battle-
Brothers. None know the roots of this practice, which for
many Imperial Fists becomes an obsession they must indulge
every hour they are not fi ghting or training. The bones of
slain kin are engraved in minute detail, every surface lovingly
covered in lines of devotional script and illuminated scenes
depicting the deeds of the fallen. Even the bones of the
Chapter’s Primarch have been engraved in this manner,
preserved as the most sacred relic the Chapter possesses.<br>
A Chapter practice of a very different kind is the use of the
“pain glove,” a body suit supported in a metal frame, into which
a Battle-Brother will step to undergo the most excruciating pain
he is able to endure. It is likely that the roots of this practice
lie in the period immediately after the Horus Heresy, when
the Imperial Fists sought to atone for their perceived sin in
failing to intervene in the Emperor’s battle against Horus. The
pain glove’s archaic systems keep the subject conscious as every
nerve in his body is shrived raw by agonising stimuli. When
he fi rst joins the Chapter, the Battle-Brother may undergo
such treatment as both a punishment for shortcomings and
failures, and as a means of inuring himself to bodily pain. Yet,
even at the very pinnacle of his abilities, a veteran Imperial
Fist will periodically don the pain glove, testing, punishing and
purifying himself in ecstatic neural flagellation.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3> 
The Imperial Fists adhere to the doctrines of the Codex
Astartes as strictly as their brothers of the Ultramarines.
Squads, companies and Chapter household are all organised
according to the standards set forth in that mighty tome, and the Chapter is capable of prosecuting every type of warfare, from orbital drops to mechanised assaults - they are the epitome of a Codex Chapter.
There is one particular method
of warfare in which the
Imperial Fists
stubbornness has meant they are naturally suited: the art of
the siege. This speciality can be counted as the result of the
Chapter’s character and doctrines, rather than an adherence to
particular tactics or equipment. The Imperial Fists are utterly
immovable in defence, and their mastery of the scientifi c
aspects of war makes them peerless as well as well dogged
when holding a fortifi ed position. The same is true in the
attack. The Imperial Fists are able to identify weak points in an
enemy’s defences, and through relentless application of force
reduce it to ruins. The Chapter is quite willing to engage the
enemy in open battle though, and does not seek urban or siege
engagements above any other method of war.<br>
The Imperial Fists’ single-mindedness does have a side
effect however. The Chapter’s refusal to accept that a position
cannot be held or the enemy cannot be cracked has on
numerous occasions resulted in far greater casualties being
suffered than other Chapters would accept. Nevertheless, the
position will be held, or the enemy broken, no matter the
cost, making the Imperial Fists one of the most celebrated and
honoured Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes.

		["Demeanour", "Sons of Dorn is a Demeanour (see page 32 of the DEATHWATCH Rulebook) unique to Space Marines from the Imperial
Fists Chapter.<br>
In temperament, Imperial Fists are driven and focussed. They study the tenets of the Codex Astartes with almost as
much dedication as the Ultramarines, yet there are certain passages their very nature makes it hard for them to fully
comprehend. Whereas the codex teaches the wisdom of a tactical re-deployment, the Imperial Fists will fi ght on, all but
blind to the consequences. While the Ultramarines might consider this characteristic a weakness, it is nonetheless the
root of their selfl ess devotion to the ideals of their Primarch.<br>
When not engaged in battle, the Imperial Fists are often driven to undertake one of several pursuits, or else be
consumed by thoughts of potential imperfections or even failures. The same drive that propelled Rogal Dorn to undertake
his post-Horus Heresy crusade still slumbers in the hearts of his sons, waiting to emerge in moments of quiet. In order
to silence such doubts, the Imperial Fists immerse themselves in the teachings of their Primarch, the histories of their
Chapter, and the study of the art and science of war. When memories of fallen comrades overtake them, some Imperial
Fists indulge in the scrimshawing of their bones, honouring the memory of those long-passed. When even these pursuits
fail to quiet the mind, the Imperial Fists don the pain-glove and subject themselves to hours of excruciating nerveshriving,
emerging hours or even days later cleansed of all doubt and pure of mind.<br>
In battle, the Imperial Fists refuse to take a step backwards or admit a foe’s superiority. They are not mindless
berserkers however, and remain disciplined and focused regardless of how desperate a situation might become—they
quite literally prefer death to the perceived dishonour of admitting the remotest possibility of defeat. When serving in
the Deathwatch, this characteristic might very well cause friction with other Space Marines, especially if a Kill-team
leader orders a tactical withdrawal in the face of the enemy. It takes a strong-willed commander indeed to convince an
Imperial Fist to withdraw when he sees only dishonour in doing so."],

		["Primarch's Curse", "
All Space Marines are the product of their genetic inheritance,
benefi ting from its blessings as well as suffering from its
shortcomings, and the Imperial Fists are no different. The
Chapter’s Primarch was a deeply devoted warrior who fought
tirelessly at the right hand of the Emperor, but even this
towering exemplar had his fl aws, as he himself is known to
have acknowledged. Perhaps because of his dedication, Dorn
was devastated when the Emperor fell, and shouldered far
more than his fair share of the blame. He cast himself into a
crusade of redemption that only ended in the terrible crucible
of Iron Cage, re-forging the Legion in the bloody furnace
of war. Dorn’s glorious legacy lives on through the Imperial
Fists, but so too does his curse.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Suffer Not Failure):</b> The Battle-Brother believes
himself defi cient in some manner, whether real or imagined,
and becomes truculent and obstructive when ordered to redeploy
in the face of a stronger foe. When acting as the Killteam’s
leader, he makes demands of his squad that others
might consider unreasonable, and views any disagreement as
outright disobedience.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Beware Hubris):</b> The Battle-Brother spends his
every waking moment brooding on past battles, seeking even
the slightest fl aw in his own deeds, and those of others. While
he stops short of outright criticism of his Battle-Brothers, he
condemns his own actions as falling short of the example
set by his Primarch, and seeks to redeem himself in the fi res
of battle.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (None Are Flawless):</b> The Battle-Brother
obsessively reviews every detail of every mission he takes part
in, fi nding fault with his own actions and those of his Killteam.
He becomes withdrawn, maudlin and confrontational,
and unwilling to accept or issue any order that does not result
in imminent battle."],
