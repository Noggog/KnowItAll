<h2>Background</h2>
The Raptors Chapter has constantly faced and overcome tragedy
throughout their ten millennia history. These begin with the disaster
of the Raven Guard Legion prior to their founding and extend
to the destruction of their home world and repeated instances of
near decimation. Their success is dependent upon their ability to
think and execute in a distributed and independent fashion. They
willingly employ whatever tactics they believe most appropriate,
relying upon success to establish their Chapter’s glory rather than
misguided notions of honour and dogmatic thought.
<br><br>
<h3>History</h3> 
In the initial stages of the Horus Heresy, the Raven Guard
Legion was decimated by the treachery of the traitor
Primarchs. Expecting a noble battle against
those who had turned against the Emperor,
the Legion was virtually overrun on
Isstvan V, when three Legions of their
supposed allies turned against them.
While Primarch Corax and a fraction
of the Legion’s Battle-Brothers
escaped, the remnants of the once
proud Legion were scarcely able
to further contribute to Terra’s
defence during the remainder
of the Heresy.<br>
In the years that followed,
the surviving members of the
Raven Guard Legion were
divided into Chapters without
the guidance of their Primarch.
The legends of the Raptors
begin during the waning
days of the Heresy. According
to legend and fragmentary
documentation, the Raptors
were formed from a company
of Raven Guard who had been
completing their training upon
Deliverance—the Legion’s home
world—when the remainder of
the Raven Guard Legion launched
its disastrous assault against Horus.
These Initiates were called into
action apart from their Legion
and served the Imperium with
distinction, earning the honour
to be created as one of the first
Successor Chapters of the
Second Founding.<br>
In their earliest days, the Raptors’ own records confirm that
they served actively as a fleet-based Chapter. Presumably, a
battle barge and appropriate support ships were assigned to
the Raptors, but few records have survived detailing either the
vessels or many of the Chapter’s early engagements. Like many
other Second Founding Chapters, their initial directive was to
aid the Imperium in its consolidation and reconciliation in the
wake of the civil war. Their success through these early years of
their existence provided ample proof of their capabilities.<br>
After a number of centuries of service, the Chapter was granted
a home world near the Eye of Terror. No longer charged with
fleet-based operations, the Raptors joined with numerous other
Chapters to share the responsibility of stopping any Chaos
forces that travelled from the terrible Warp manifestation. All
signs suggest that the Chapter served capably in fulfilling
their responsibilities for millennia. However,
during one of Abaddon’s Black Crusades—
likely the 4th or 5th—their home world
was destroyed. This disaster occurred in
either M34 or M36. With the world’s
destruction, all of the Chapter’s early
trophies, records, and much of its
most valuable and ancient wargear
were all annihilated.<br>
In M37, Imperial records
indicate that the entire Raptors
Chapter was listed among those
Space Marines who had gone
missing and were presumed killed
in action. All signs indicate that
they maintained this status for
more than two millennia. The
cause behind this disappearance
is unclear, and lost to the ages.<br>
It was not until the Caberiad
Wars of early M39 that the
Raptors resumed their status as a
full strength Space Marine Chapter.
Their actions during the intervening
millennia are unclear. The Chapter
may have been rebuilding from
a substantial loss, or they might
have spent this time fighting in,
and escaping from, the terrors
of the Warp. Regardless, at this
point one key element of the
Raptors’ incarnation became
clear. During the Caberiad
Wars, the Raptors had
access to an ample supply line. References from other Imperial sources indicated that they
have once more taken a home world and re-established a fortress
monastery. Based upon transit times, that world is located within
the Sutter Spiral Nebula. However, none of the Battle-Brothers
have disclosed the name or precise location of the home world,
even to members of the Adeptus Administratum.
<br><br>
<h3>Homeworld</h3> 
The Raptors Chapter is quite deliberately vague in any discussions
of their home world. This is among their fellow Battle-Brothers
as well as in discussions with outsiders. It is in their nature to be
secretive and to value the careful application of stealth. The fact
that the Raptors lost their first home world only serves to intensify
their concern. The safe preservation of their adopted home is
clearly a priority for the Raptors. However, this has become a
point of concern between the Adeptus Administratum and the
Chapter. Not only could this act of independence have heretical
consequences, but it effectively complicates any communications
between Terra and the Chapter.
<br><br>
<h3>Gene-Seed</h3> 
losses on several occasions. In spite of this, as a testament
to their perserverence, they have managed to recover each
time. This ability to rebuild in spite of massive losses also
suggests that their gene-seed is healthy and stable. Under the
conditions of rebuilding, the success of each implantation
into a Neophyte is crucial for the Chapter’s survival.<br>
In spite of this fact, many of the flaws of their predecessor
Chapter continue to haunt the Raptors. As with the Raven Guard,
Battle-Brothers of the Raptors Chapter gradually attain an everpaler
skin tone as they age. After just a few centuries of service,
some have skin that is very nearly translucent. At the same time,
their hair colour darkens, so that the Chapter’s veterans are easily
identified by their black hair and pale complexions. Again, like
their progenitors, the Raptors also lack a functional Mucranoid
Implant. However, they do have a fully functional Betcher’s
Gland. It is unclear if this organ was somehow recovered by the
Raptors or if their Founding occurred prior to the Raven Guard
Chapter losing that organ from their standard array of implants.
<br><br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3> 
The Raptors Chapter is renowned for the pragmatism of its Battle-
Brothers. In combat situations, the Raptors constantly strive to find
the most apt solution to any given situation. In order to attain such
a goal, the Chapter’s Battle-Brothers are trained in a variety of ways
that are remarkably inconsistent with most other Space Marine
Chapters. Perhaps most critical of these changes is their attitude
towards the Codex. The Raptors consider the Codex Astartes to
be a critical guide to strategy and tactics. They do not, however,
consider that its words must be obeyed without question.<br>
Ultimately, the Raptors Chapter is focused upon success in all of
their endeavours.. Failure is never an acceptable option, but neither
is an approach that needlessly throws away the lives of Battle-
Brothers or irreplaceable wargear. When an objective is identified,
these Space Marines pursue that goal relentlessly. However, their
tactics are seldom direct. They study a situation intently, so that
they may accomplish their goal with a minimum of risk.<br>
This outlook has often caused tension during those missions
where the Raptors work closely with Space Marines of other
Chapters. On more than one occasion, they have been accused of cowardice. Members of the Raptors do not look kindly upon such
accusations, but they seldom take such insults as a major affront.
For their part, the Raptors consider the more orthodox Chapters
to be blind adherents to tradition. While they do seldom instigate
such rivalry, they accept it and reluctantly participate in it when the
actions do not interfere with accomplishing their objectives.<br>
Flexibility also plays a key role in their decision making
process. Conditions in the field often change with alarming
speed. Before a Space Marine of the Raptors Chapter can
assume an officer’s responsibilities, he is thoroughly trained in
all aspects of battlefield awareness and observation. Tactical
cognisance and strategic prioritisation play crucial roles at
every level of command. These Battle-Brothers are expected
to identify any changes that occur through the course of
a battle—including unexpected enemy response—at the
earliest stages and act upon them accordingly.<br>
Throughout the Chapter, blind obedience is strongly
discouraged. All of these Space Marines are expected to act
upon their own initiative at the appropriate times. However,
such actions must fit within the context of the larger battle
scheme. Battle-Brothers consider unorthodox tactics during
their preparation for any conflict. These include unusual
deployment manoeuvres and infiltration. At times, they have
gone so far as to assemble ad hoc units specifically appropriate
for resolving a particular tactical problem.<br>
In this same way, Battle-Brothers of the Raptors Chapter will
concede the articles of faith and honour in the name of victory, they
also willingly concede minor objectives in the interest of achieving
overall military success. This idea is foreign to many of the other
Chapters of the Adeptus Astartes but well within the goal-focused
flexibility of the Raptors. Their continued focus on the overall
conflict and goals rather than individual honour or glory are key
to propagating this ideal among the Chapter’s Battle-Brothers.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3> 
Flexibility and willingness to adapt to their situation represents
the core of the Raptors’ Combat Doctrine. As they prepare to
engage their opponents, these Space Marines are always careful
to identify all of their assets and utilise them to the fullest means
possible. These often include assets that are not identified within
the constraints of the Codex Astartes. Even when operating well
within the strictures of that tome, these Battle-Brothers may choose
to take measures that others might consider dishonourable. For
members of the Raptors Chapter, the only important standard is
success. Honour and glory are noble notions, but a clear victory is
worth far more than any amount of either. Most of the distinctive
combat tactics that the Raptors employ are tied into this notion.<br>
Many Space Marine Chapters exhibit a clear disdain for the
use of concealment, secrecy, espionage, and counter-intelligence.
The Raptors know, however, that it provides a limited number
of countermeasures to overcome those who would use such
deception against members of the Adeptus Astartes. However, the
Raptors Chapter enthusiastically and consistently applies these
techniques throughout its battles. Deceiving their opponents as
to the timing, nature, and objectives of an attack can often grant
the Space Marines a significant tactical advantage.<br>
Similarly, by expertly scouting a region prior to launching an
attack, the Raptors often are able to insert their forces without their
opponents realising the number or nature of the opposing forces.
However, such insertions are entirely dependent upon the reliability
and accuracy of their initial reconnaissance work. This requires
extensive dependence upon their Scout units, which exceeds the
level characteristic of many other Space Marine Chapters.<br>
When engaged in scouting missions, the Chapter’s Battle-
Brothers typically focus on both gathering intelligence and on
countering the opposition’s efforts. Just as they work to penetrate
the fog of war, they may also deliver false—but credible—
information. Consequently, at the same time as the Space Marines
penetrate directly to the most vulnerable points of their opponent’s
strategy, those opponents are unable to locate the heart of the
Raptor’s forces. This stratagem has often enabled the Raptors to
effectively engage opponents that enjoy an even greater numerical
advantage than is typical for Imperial Space Marine forces.<br>
In keeping with their willingness to make use of every
available resource, the Raptors Chapter often takes direct charge
of any Imperial Guard units available. Rather than deferring
to the organisation’s intrinsic leadership, these Space Marines
deploy their members among the merely human forces and
then take a direct hand in their disposition and tactics.<br>
During the course of an engagement, there are two favoured
elements to any plan that these Battle-Brothers are likely to enact.
The first is a supreme reliance upon their marksmanship. It is
unclear if enhanced marksmanship is an innate element in the
Raptors gene-seed or simply a consequence of their training. In
either case, these Space Marines are highly skilled sharpshooters
even by the exceptionally high standards of the Adeptus Astartes.<br>
The second core strategy is the use of the hit and run tactic. The
Raptors Chapter is exceptionally well equipped with assault bikes,
land speeders, and jump packs. Whenever possible, these Space
Marines favour the use of guerrilla tactics and ambushes to deplete
enemy forces prior to a more traditional engagement. Millennia of
refining their techniques has enhanced their abilities to the point
that these Battle-Brothers are often able to decimate enemy forces
through precision surgical strikes, minimising the enemy forces
present in future conflicts. When these tactics are considered in
combination with their extraordinary marksmanship, it is not
surprising that some have likened the Chapter to assassins. To
accommodate this tendency, the Raptors keep an atypically sizable
contingent of all types of Land Speeders as part of their armoury.<br>
In keeping with the value that these Space Marines place upon
independent thought, each of the Raptors’ companies operates on
a largely independent basis. It is only in reaction to a particularly
dire threat that multiple companies gather to cooperate. For the
last few millennia, they have been fought across the breadth of
the Imperium, wherever they have been needed.",

		["Demeanour", "A History of Pragmatism is a Demeanour (see page 32 of the DEATHWATCH Core Rulebook) unique to Space Marines
from the Raptors Chapter.<br>
At various times during its history, the Raptors have almost faced extinction but has neither the less continued to function,
rebuild and once more face their enemies. It is part of the Raptor mentality that the Chapter will endure no matter the cost and
that the eventual destruction and rebuilding of all Chapters in the Adeptus Astartes is inevitable. As one Battle-Brother dies,
another takes his place to continue the endless struggle where the gene-seed lives on but the warrior does not. Death is the
only constant in the universe and regardless of victory or defeat the only reward a Battle-Brother can look forward to.<br>
Quite apart from casting a dark cloud over the Battle-Brothers of the Raptors Chapter, it fills them with stoic pragmatism to
face everything that the universe can throw at them, to fulfil their duty until they eventually die and another takes their place. The
galaxy and its many horrors hold no surprises for them and they know that somewhere out there among the inky black is the piece
of ground where they will fall, having served their Emperor and held back the night at least for a brief time.<br>
Other Chapters can find these attitudes at odds with a strong devotion to the Emperor and the righteous plight
of mankind, though the Raptors see the two as intertwined, and their Chapter has always done its duty and remains
unquestionably loyal to the Imperium. For a Raptors Battle-Brother facing death is only a matter of time, and they carry
the knowledge with them every day, alongside their duty to their brothers and their oath to the God-Emperor."],

Black Templars are filled with a righteous power and hatred
for the witch and heretic even beyond that of the other
Chapters. It is a religious madness that is often expressed
with valour and fearlessness on the battlefield, but it can also
turn the Battle-Brother against all creatures touched with the
psyker’s gift, be they friend or foe.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (The Shadow of Death):</b> The Battle-Brother starts to
see death in everything. He becomes distant and makes little effort
to forge new alliances with new squad members, knowing they
will soon be in the grave. He becomes more dismissive of death
and the praising of the dead, seeing little glory in their sacrifice,
only the inevitable end to their duty and another corpse to feed
the gods of war. This attitude can grate on those around the Battle-
Brother and he suffers a –10 to his Fellowship when dealing with
other soldiers or members of the Adeptus Astartes.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (The Bad Beneath the Good):</b> The Battle-Brother
cannot help but reflect on the worst side of a new development and
will endeavour to find the worst aspect of even the most favourable
of circumstances. Quite apart from causing friction within his squad,
the drawing of focus onto potential problems and unforeseen
dangers (regardless of the actual likelihood they will impact on
the squad’s mission) can cause compromises in command and less
than direct tactical judgements. When the Battle-Brother’s squad
embarks on a mission, he must choose one of the Secondary or
Primary objectives to cast doubt on. This objective then requires
3d10 more Kill-markers than normal to complete.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Game Over):</b> Death is inevitable and the Battle-
Brother is already a walking corpse just waiting for the moment
when an enemy’s blade or bullet ends him. Filled with visions
of his own demise, the Battle-Brother begins to act recklessly,
accepting that it is his time and there is nothing he can do to
prevent it coming. This will not only place him in danger but
can endanger his entire squad. The Battle-Brother does not
contribute to the squad Cohesion as he fails to adequately aid
them in battle. In addition, he only gains half the normal armour
points from cover, as even when behind barricades and walls he
exposes himself to fire with little mind to remaining concealed."],
