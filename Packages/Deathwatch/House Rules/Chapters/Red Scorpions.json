<h2>Background</h2>
The origins of the Red Scorpions Chapter is clouded in
mystery and undoubtedly lost to the passage of time.
Their recorded history extends across five millennia,
but there are numerous indications that it may extend further
than that. Throughout their existence, its members have been
intently focused on maintaining the purity of the Imperium
and protecting humanity from any possible contamination.
They believe strongly in the divinity of the God-Emperor
and see their ongoing quest for mental, spiritual, and physical
purity as a divine mandate.
<br><br>
<h3>History</h3> 
It is unclear if the mysteries concerning the Red Scorpions
Chapter’s origins are due to a deliberate decision within the
Adeptus Administratum or if the records might have been lost due
to a simple clerical error. As neither the Chapter nor any known
Imperial sources make record of their founding, the former
seems far more likely than the latter. Ongoing attempts
have been made to at least identify the origin of
the Chapter’s gene-seed—in spite of formal
complaints levelled by the Chapter’s
leadership—but even these have met
with universal failure. Ultimately,
the story of the Chapter’s creation is
far less important than the glorious
history that they have established
by consistently protecting the
Imperium against countless threats.<br>
Always a crusading Chapter, the
Red Scorpions have participated
in a number of unusual events
throughout their history. Some of
these are virtually unparalleled
and inexplicable. These oddities
only serve to propagate the
myths that have left outsiders
concerned about their true
origins and motivations. For
example, in early M39, the
entire Chapter undertook
a crusade into the Ordon
Rift within Segmentum
Tempestus. During
this crusade, the
Chapter had no
communication
withthebroader
Imperium. It
is unclear if
this was due to
Warp complications in the region or if it was a deliberate choice
made by the Red Scorpions. When the Chapter finally returned
to the Imperium—after more than three centuries of absence, the
Adeptus Administratum was shocked to discover them still alive.
The timely nature of their reappearance was also viewed as a gift
from the Emperor, as they played a crucial role in overcoming a
Night Lords attack on Oriflame.<br>
Few details from their crusade within the Ordon Rift have
emerged. Perhaps the most important of these has been shared
with only the highest ranking members of the Administratum.
Specifically, that the Red Scorpions founded a permanent base
within the Ordon Rift. This new world now served as the
basis for their recruitment efforts, but was kept isolated and
hidden from the remainder of the Imperium. Only through
such extreme measures of secrecy could the Chapter maintain a
level of security and purity that met with their
exacting standards.<br>
Their concern with impurity led
directly to another incident of
note during the Red Scorpions’
storied history. In 857.M38,
the Chapter responded to a
call to cleanse the world of
Helios of traitors who had
turned against the Imperium.
The war effort had been in
progress for several decades, with
Imperial Guard forces incapable
of turning the tide. Shortly after
their arrival, the Space Marines
launched an assault against the
traitor’s massively reinforced
battle fortress. Much to their
surprise, the Battle-Brothers
soon discovered that their
traditional armaments were
incapable of overcoming
the resistance mounted upon
its adamantine walls. Because
the Chapter Master distrusted the
Imperial Guard forces, he commanded
the Master of the Forge to create an
alternative solution. The result was the
Land Raider Helios, a variant which
mounts a Whirlwind missile launcher
atop a standard land raider hull.
This hybrid tank soon proved its
efficacy and was later accepted
by the Adeptus Mechanicus as an
alternative pattern.<br>
In stark contrast, the Red Scorpions proved that they are
capable of working in concert with other forces in 633.M39,
during their participation in the 2nd Aegisine Crusade. The
forge world of Shaehol had fallen under the influence of a
heretical sect of the Adeptus Mechanicus. Its defences were
thought to be impenetrable, and the crusade’s command
elements feared that it might be impossible to retake without
the use of orbital bombardment—an alternative that might
render many of the planet’s assets irrecoverable. The Red
Scorpions Chapter volunteered to make the initial insertion
via a concerted Drop Pod attack, which was later supported by
Thunderhawks. In short order, the Space Marines established
a beachhead against nigh overwhelming resistance. Over the
course of nearly 24 hours, the Battle-Brothers fought wave
after wave of corrupted Mechanicus forces, granting the
Battle Titans of Legio Tempestor an opportunity to land and
deploy their forces. Without the Space Marines’ sacrifices, the
Collegia Titanica forces would have suffered unacceptable
losses in the course of their insertion. Over the next two years,
the Red Scorpions Chapter fought side by side with the other
members of the crusade, eventually cleansing the world of its
traitorous infestation and liberating its manufactorums so that
they could once more support the crusade’s efforts.
<br><br>
<h3>Homeworld</h3> 
For the first several millennia of their existence, the Red
Scorpions were exclusively a fleet-based Chapter. Their two
battle barges, the Sword of Ordon and Auel’s Bane, have long
served as focal points of their fleet. The Red Scorpions’
reserves were generally divided between the two, so that in
the event one was lost, the Chapter would not be decimated.
While the Chapter Masters were well aware of the risks that
this entailed, they were unwilling to establish a foothold as the
Chapter was always on the move conducting its crusades.<br>
During their extended crusade into the Ordon Rift, the
Chapter seized control of the feral world of Zaebus Minoris.
They also constructed a battle station—Vigil—which
remains in orbit around the planet. Since that time, they have
maintained the highest levels of secrecy about their holding.
Of the few outsiders that are aware—mostly high ranking
members of the Adeptus Administratum—none know the
Warp routes to reach the world. Travel through the Ordon
Rift is a treacherous undertaking. Without knowing the
precise routes, a journey to the world entails substantial risk.<br>
Prior to securing Zaebus Minoris, the Red Scorpions
Chapter recruited the purest candidates they could find
from throughout the galaxy. Since seizing control of the
world in M39, the vast majority of its new initiates have
come from the native feral tribes. Only the most heroic and
pure of potential candidates that they encounter elsewhere
are even considered for initiation.<br>
Zaebus Minoris is maintained at a cultural and technological
level that is more primitive than earth’s Bronze Age. A
convenient cultural phenomenon enables the Red Scorpions to
easily secure recruits from the native inhabitants. During the
first full moon after a male child’s birth, he waits on a stone
altar for judgement by the gods. Some die to exposure, others
survive to mature among the native population, but a few are
taken by the Chapter’s Apothecaries. These go on to become
the Chapter’s Initiates, with no memory of their native cultures.
Thus the boys may be properly indoctrinated to the ways of
the Chapter from almost the moment of their birth.
<br><br>
<h3>Gene-Seed</h3> 
The Red Scorpions take tremendous pride in the purity of their
gene-seed. While its lack of contamination is unquestionably
accurate, its purity extends to the point that it shows little sign
of distinction. Space Marines of some other Chapters distrust
the Red Scorpions for this very reason. The generalised nature
of the gene-seed makes it impossible to trace its origin back
to any of the loyalist Primarchs.<br>
Regardless of its origins, the gene-seed has shown
tremendous stability throughout the Chapter’s history. It is
undoubtedly clear that their near obsessive approach to insure
stability and purity factor into this. However, even with these
steps, the initial gene-seed must have been free from flaws in
order for none to have surfaced over the intervening millennia
since their founding. In order to maintain this purity, the Red
Scorpions have maintained a strict protocol of isolationism,
so that outside contaminants may not weaken the Chapter.<br>
Every member of the Chapter is regularly screened by its
Apothecaries for any signs of taint. This screening approaches
a level of fanatical devotion in its rigour. Apothecaries are also
always kept close at hand to recover the progenoid glands of
any fallen Battle-Brother, so that the gene-seed is preserved
far more often than is typically expected.
<br><br>
<h3>Philosophy</h3>
The most central tenet of the Red Scorpions Chapter’s belief
system is a focus on purity. All other concepts are secondary.
To maintain their purity—in mind, body, and spirit—the
Chapter’s Battle-Brothers accept unquestionably extreme
measures as a necessary part of their training regimen. It is
their shared belief that only by undertaking such strenuous
measures can they hope to identify and eliminate even the
smallest taint of imperfection or contamination in those they
encounter from without the Chapter.<br>
For these Space Marines, their mission is a divine mandate.
As they do not know the identity of their primarch, their
primary devotion is directly to the God-Emperor. It may be
due to this lack of a connection to another spiritual authority
that, atypically, the Chapter puts their faith and trust in the
truly divine nature of the Emperor and pledge their loyalty to
the Imperial Cult.<br>
The Chapter is largely traditional in their beliefs and
loyalties. Their Chaplain’s have a distinct interpretation of
the Codex, to which they adhere extremely closely. In their
eyes, they do not deviate from its words in any fashion. As
religious zealots, they are morally obligated to follow its
sacred directive. Any deviation from its teachings must be
thoroughly justified, as such remains a clear violation of the
God-Emperor’s directive.<br>
The Red Scorpions Space Marines drive themselves
endlessly to insure their purity. They expect other members
of the Imperium to maintain similar standards. However, by
virtually any other standard, the Red Scorpions are among the
most zealous and ardent of believers. Further, their physical
enhancements enable them to survive acts of penance that
would kill a mere mortal. Few others are physically capable
of maintaining a lifestyle that adheres to the high standards
set by these Space Marines. As other Space Marines seldom
follow the tenets of the Imperial Cult, there are few who
willingly embrace such a lifestyle.<br>
This combination has led to the Chapter’s Battle-Brothers
having very little respect for other Imperial forces. Even
during briefings and planning sessions, a Red Scorpions
officer might question the judgement of those outside his
Chapter, as their lack of purity could easily beget treachery
and heresy. This overriding concern leaves the Chapter
largely unwilling to work with outsiders, save in the direst
of circumstances. Some view this tendency as approaching an
isolationist set of beliefs. However, others gladly encourage
the Red Scorpions to work independently—accommodating
their rigourous standards can be an exhausting process for
any who must negotiate or work with them.<br>
Another critical expression of their obsession with purity is
in their reaction to any sign of impurity. These Battle-Brothers
consider hatred of the unclean and unholy as one of their most
central virtues. That which might be contaminated may not
be trusted. That which is known to be contaminated must be
eliminated with an appropriate application of force. As all xenos
are, by their very nature, impure, they must be cleansed upon
contact. Anyone that is of potential human heritage must be tested
for mutation. Those who are found wanting must be eliminated at
the earliest possible opportunity. Similarly, an unclean mind, tainted
by heresy or unbelief, must be thoroughly cleansed, preferably
by force. Red Scorpions have no tolerance at all for those who
violate these precepts. Even accepted mutations, such as nominally
accepted abhumans or Navigators are kept at a distance. Were it
not for the necessity of having a Navigator amongst their crew, it is
likely that the Red Scorpions would directly oppose them.<br>
This also affects the Chapter’s interactions with other
Space Marines. The Red Scorpions hold a particular distrust
for those—such as the Space Wolves or the Blood Angels—
that have been cursed in such a way to diverge from the
standard of the Codex Astartes. In several instances, they
have been unwilling to work directly with Imperial forces
that they consider a risk for contamination.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3>
The Red Scorpions are dedicated believers in their
interpretation of the Codex Astartes. To these Space Marines,
the text represents a divine mandate that instructs them in
every phase of their existence. When preparing for battle, the
sacred text must be appropriately interpreted, but its wisdom
must never be questioned. Many of the Chapter’s commanders
use individual subsections to identify critical stages within
every conflict. These individuals carefully identify the most
relevant portions as they prepare for and command a battle,
immediately and definitively using the most appropriate
responses to any numerical or strategic shifts in a given battle,
such that the army’s forces constantly adjust their strategic
responses as the tactical situation changes.<br>
Of course, it is important to consider that the Codex Astartes
is generally regarded as the most complete and advanced
guide to warfare ever created by mankind. While its insights
and advice may not address every imaginable situation, its
framework offers a method for methodically and appropriately identifying the most apt solution. By choosing to dogmatically
follow the Codex in every possible way, the Red Scorpions
are dependent upon a tactical treatise that is unparalleled.
Ultimately, the appearance of orthodoxy and fanaticism does
not functionally limit their combat effectiveness.<br>
The Chapter is organised into ten companies in keeping with
standard Codex directive. Of their ten companies, there is only a
single divergence. The Chapter maintains only its second through
fourth Companies as Battle Companies. The fifth serves as an
additional reserve company, like the sixth and seventh. Their tenth,
Scout Company, is generally kept slightly under strength due to
their inability to aggressively recruit while actively on Crusade.
In keeping with the Codex’s teachings, the Red Scorpions excel
at applying a combined arms solution to most tactical situations.
For example, vehicles are used to support infantry units. Similarly,
specialised infantry, such as Assault Marines, are carefully used only
in those situations that are most easily overcome by their particular
expertise. The Chapter’s orbital resources may be used as necessary
to soften a target well in advance of a ground based offensive. Such
approaches have been exercised in a consistent fashion throughout
the Chapter’s history.<br>
Part of their success is due to the intense level of discipline
maintained throughout the Chapter. To a certain extent, this
discipline is instilled through the use of their religious focus in
every aspect of their lives. Unquestioning obedience is second
nature for Red Scorpions Battle-Brothers. They firmly believe
that their lives are dedicated to and directly guided by the God-
Emperor. They trust in his guidance and the knowledge that if
their lives are lost, they can enter the afterlife to enjoy His
eternal blessings. This level of discipline enables the Chapter’s
commanders to execute strategies that might be highly risky
when utilising troops that were not so thoroughly devoted to
seeing a plan through to its completion.<br>
In spite of their obsession with dogma, the Red Scorpions
are more than capable of innovating novel solutions to
unexpected problems. The creation of the Helios pattern
Land Raider is the best known example, but it is certainly not
the only one. This particular success is best known because
the vehicle went on to gain ratification by the Adeptus
Mechanicus. Since its creation, several other Chapters have
begun to employ the variant.<br>
Every battle fought against an unidentified opponent
requires a warrior to first identify the foe’s strengths and
weaknesses. Only once these are known can strengths be
avoided and weakness exploited. The Red Scorpions are
adept at using a variety of different approaches against
new foes in remarkably short order. Once a particularly
effective tactic is identified, it is then used for as long as
it remains effective. However, if no commonly known
methods provide a necessary solution, these Space Marines
do not hesitate to attempt to find an alternative. Though
even in this methodology, purity must be maintained.
While their Techmarines might develop minor innovations,
they do not stray from the Omnissiah’s path. Xenos
designs or equipment that has survived from the Dark
Age of Technology remain anathema. The use of such
devices could endanger a Battle-Brother’s soul with the
potential for contamination. Alternative tactical measures
are considered, but only once evidence has been compiled
that those dictated by the Codex are inappropriate. At
times, this may require exhaustive and thorough analyses
and discussions.<br>
The Red Scorpions are generally philosophically
opposed to the use of covert techniques prior to and
during a battle. They prefer to proudly demonstrate their
presence and their markings. They firmly believe that their iconography and wargear are a crucial symbol of their
allegiance to the God-Emperor. Anything that prevents
their foes from seeing these insignia is a veritable affront
to their faith. While they have been known to use Codex
standard camouflage patterns, even these are accepted
only with reluctance. Initiates are trained as scouts, in
keeping with the Codex standard, but even they are
seldom assigned to protracted reconnaissance missions.
Instead, their Neophytes are generally deployed to either
the main battle lines or held in reserve so that they may
serve as a reserve force.<br>
In spite of their continued role as a crusading
Chapter, the Red Scorpions have suffered relatively few
losses to their armoury. They remain surprisingly wellequipped
with Land Raiders, Dreadnoughts, artefacts, and
an assortment of other vehicles. The one item that is in
relatively short supply is Terminator Armour. In fact, this
precious commodity is in such short supply that not even
half of the 1st company may be equipped with such sacred
relics. Because of this, it is relatively common for the
Chapter’s veterans to serve as sergeants among the squads
of the other companies.",

Red Scorpions Chapter.<br>
The Red Scorpions Chapter prides itself on the purity of its Battle-Brothers and the sanctity of its gene-seed. In the eyes
of the Chapter masters, few other members of the Adpetus Astartes can lay claim to such a lineage and a genetic link to the
Emperor, while those outside the Adeptus Astartes are almost always tainted by corruption despite any protests of loyalty
or claims about the strength of their humanity. Protecting and preserving their purity, and eliminating all signs of taint are
therefore very important to the Red Scorpions and part of every Battle-Brother’s training and daily observances.<br>
While all Space Marines abhor mutants and aliens, the Red Scorpions reserve a special vehemence for them. The line
Red Scorpions draw between those the Imperium considers human and those it does not is far higher than almost any
other Chapter, usually making the distinction that unless a man can claim direct descent from the Emperor himself (like
the Red Scorpions) he is a flawed being despite his intentions.<br>
This fanaticism for extreme genetic purity is most pronounced when in the presence of those tainted by the Ruinous
Powers, or those suspected of such taint. All it takes is suspicion for the Red Scorpions to shift their stance with their
allies, and once the hint of taint has attached itself to such allies they must work hard to lift it by proving their devotion
to the Emperor beyond any shadow of a doubt."],

		["Primarch's Curse", "
The Red Scorpions hold themselves to the highest of standards
and consider their loyalty second to none when compared to
other servants of the God-Emperor and soldiers of the Imperium.
Part of this pride and their unswerving adherence to the Codex
and its teachings is justified in the purity of their gene-seed and
the glorious record of wars and battles won in the Emperor’s
name, though more cynical minds might wonder if the mysteries
of the Red Scorpions past and their origins might also have
something to do with their fanatical desire to prove their loyalty
and that they are beyond the reproach of their peers. Whatever
the cause, the end result is a strong distrust in allies fostered by
many Red Scorpions which can become more acute over time
until many of the Chapter come to believe that none among the
followers or children of the Emperor share their own purity and
strength of loyalty, and can never be fully trusted.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Only the Pure):</b> The Battle-Brother has come to
question the purity of all the servants of the God-Emperor and cannot believe that they are somehow without fault or flaw. This
is especially true of obviously tainted allies, despite any kind of
sanctioning, such as psykers, abhumans, and navigators. When
the Battle-Brother must deal with anyone with a psychic gift (not
including Librarians of his own Chapter), or a mutation (no matter
how benign or beneficial) he suffers a –10 to Fellowship Tests.
Such a cold reception is almost always reciprocated and such
individuals often feel intensely uncomfortable in the presence
of the Battle-Brother, aware of the hulking warrior’s scorn, and
worsen their Disposition (see page 276 of the DEATHWATCH Core
Rulebook) by one step when in the Battle-Brothers presence.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (True Sons of the Emperor):</b> While it has always
been held that the Adeptus Astartes stand above all other warriors
of the God-Emperor, many of the Chapters consider themselves
equals and there is usually a degree of respect afforded between
Battle-Brothers no matter their origins. Red Scorpions can come
to believe that this is a falsehood, and that no other Chapter
can hope to match their loyalty, seeing other Space Marines are
lesser copies of themselves and ultimately not as worthy of their
position in the armies of the Emperor. The effects of Only the
Pure (see above) now apply to Space Marines as well (with the
exception of other Red Scorpions). In addition, if the Battle-
Brother is squad leader he must reduce the amount of Cohesion
he contributes to the Kill-team by 2, or 1 if there is at least one
other Red Scorpion as part of the Kill-team.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (None but Us):</b> In time, a Red Scorpions Battle-
Brother can come to believe that only his Chapter alone can be
trusted and those around him, despite their outward claims and
displays of loyalty, are in fact unreliable; traitors waiting to turn
their cloaks. Though the Battle-Brother would not move against
such men without just cause, as such rash actions would shame
his Chapter and go against the Codex Astartes which he holds
in such high regard, he will be careful not to give them too
much power over him or expose his back unless he has to. The
Battle-Brother will not work well in a Kill-team with members
of other Chapters. All Squad Mode abilities cost 1 additional
Cohesion point if they include the Battle-Brother and the Battle-
Brother cannot benefit at all from the Squad Mode abilities of
other Chapters (though they may still be active and used by the
other members of the Kill-team as normal)."],
