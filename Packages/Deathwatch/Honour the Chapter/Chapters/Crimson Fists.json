<h2>Background</h2>
After the Great Heresy, Rogal Dorn, primarch of the
Imperial Fists, resisted the breaking up of the Legions
into smaller Chapters. It was only when the Imperial
Fists were branded heretics that Dorn relented, allowing his
beloved Legion to be subdivided into Chapters. One of the
new Chapters born of this time was the Black Templars.<br>
To prove his loyalty to the Emperor, the first Chapter Master
of the Black Templars—the High Marshal Sigismund—
assembled a massive war fleet and began the greatest Space
Marine Crusade in the history of the Imperium. It has lasted
for 10,000 years.<br>
Eschewing the establishment of a home world, the Black
Templars took to the stars in a mighty war fleet. Rather than
constructing a single Chapter fortress-monastery as most
Space Marine Chapters do, the Black Templars determined
to establish a chapter keep upon each world they conquered,
to keep watch for treachery, to stage future Crusades, and to
recruit new Battle-Brothers.<br>
The ten-millennia-long Crusade of the Black Templars
has seen its warriors embroiled in some of the most
momentous conflicts ever to engulf the Imperium.
The High Marshals have followed the example of their
founder and taken the fight to the realms of
the alien, the heretic, and the witch. The
Black Templars are crusaders,
holy warriors battling to
bring the truth and light
of the Emperor to the
unconquered worlds of the
galaxy. With bolt shell and
chainsword, the Black Templars
convert the benighted to the light of the
Master of Mankind and destroy those who refuse
to welcome his truth. Each Crusade is directed
by the will of the Marshal in command, and each
is despatched by the decree of the High Marshal
of the Black Templars to fulfil their prime
mission to cleanse the stars.
<br><br>
<h3>Initiations</h3> Despite that Rogal Dorn eventually accepted the dictates
of the Codex Astartes, the Black Templars are organised
in a different manner to many Space Marine Chapters and
deviate from the strictures of Guilliman's great tome in several
notable ways. One deviation is in the recruitment and training
of its warriors. The Black Templars have no Scout company in which new recruits may prove their mettle. The Chapter must
judge the worthiness of its recruits in other ways. From the
monolithic chapter keeps they establish on every world the
Black Templars conquer, the Chaplains maintain a strict vigil
over the world and judge the worth of those warriors who
attract their notice. Often, there will be contests of arms or
other equally lethal trials held for those who aspire to joining
the Chapter. Only the bravest warriors can hope to reach the
final stages of selection and even then only a fraction will meet
the Chaplains' high standards.<br>
An aspirant is brought to the chapter keep, where the
Apothecaries administer tissue compatibility tests and root out
any latent mutation to ensure that he is of sufficient purity and
strength to become a Neophyte. Not all survive these processes,
as the Black Templars tolerate no weakness. Should the aspirant
survive, he becomes a Neophyte and so begins the ritual
surgery that will turn him into a superhuman warrior. Here too,
an aspirant may fail. Thanks to the degeneration of knowledge,
implant surgery is heavily ritualised. It is often accompanied by
scarring, incantation, prayer, fasting, and arcane practices that
unintentionally compromise medical efficiency.<br>
Once a Neophyte begins his training, he severs all links
with the world of his birth and begins a life dedicated to the
Emperor. Once he is deemed ready, he will be taken under
the wing of an Initiate and complete his training in the fires
of battle, where he will either learn or die. When he finally
becomes an Initiate himself, he can no longer be considered
human. Any chance for a normal life is gone forever,
but though a great and terrible sacrifice, it is
made willingly.<br>
Once accepted within one of a Crusade's
Fighting Companies, an Initiate fights and
hones his craft of death, building his legend
and forging his hero's name before one day
going on to train a Neophyte himself. In
this way, the experience and wisdom of
the Initiates is preserved and passed
on to new recruits.<br>
The greatest warriors in a
Fighting Company will be
organised into the Marshal's
household, the equivalent of a
Codex Chapter's First Company.
Known as the Sword Brethren,
these Space Marines are mighty
heroes whose deeds become part
of the Chapter's history. It is
every Black Templar's ambition
to become one of these elite. Clad
in the finest suits of armour and
bedecked with purity seals, the
Sword Brethren are the very image
of a baroque warrior-knight. When
a Marshal dies, it is from the Sword
Brethren that his replacement will be
drawn, and only the best and bravest
are worthy of this great honour. Which
Black Templar will succeed the Marshal is
determined by ritual combat, during which all 
who would contest the right to lead the Crusade will battle one
another with various weapons as well as pitting their strategic
and tactical prowess against their opponent. The winner earns
the right to be Marshal, subject to the approval of the High
Marshal, and the Sword Brethren swear new oaths of loyalty
to the winner.<br>
Aside from the Marshal's household, larger Crusades are
broken down into a number of Fighting Companies, each
led by a Sword Brethren afforded the honorific of ‘Castellan.'
Within the Fighting Company, individual squads are gathered
and dispersed in a fairly ad-hoc fashion. Initiates fight side
by side regularly out of familiarity and comradeship rather
than any imposed organisation. Due to the Chapter's focus on
engaging the foe in the blood and fury of honourable close
combat, there is a notable lack of heavy weapons in the Fighting
Companies. Such heavy weapons are mounted on vehicles and
Dreadnoughts, leaving the Battle-Brothers to close on their foe
unhindered.
<br><br>
<h3>Eternal Crusaders</h3>
The Black Templars have no single home world. Instead, they
live in their Crusade fleets, upon many battle-barges, strike
cruisers, training vessels, and gigantic forgeships. The Black
Templars establish chapter keeps on every world they conquer
or reclaim for the Emperor. The main purpose of the chapter
keeps is to recruit new Space Marines from the population,
and to act as staging posts for mustering the Crusades. These
chapter keeps are sizeable, with chambers to accommodate two
to three companies of Space Marines, but are far smaller than
the fortress-monasteries of other Chapters. However, there have
been hundreds of chapter keeps established over the millennia,
some of which are still standing, others which have fallen into
ruin and disrepair and are no longer manned.<br>
The High Marshal himself has his own battle-barge, the
Eternal Crusader, and he can travel from Crusade to Crusade
lending his military genius and spiritual guidance to those
under his command. The Eternal Crusader is gigantic, even
for a battle-barge, having been expanded and refitted over ten 
thousand years with extra docking facilities for escort ships,
additional launch bays for shuttles and Thunderhawk gunships,
as well as accommodation for twice as many Space Marines
than a normal battle-barge.
<br><br>
<h3>Righteous Zeal</h3>
All Space Marines are renowned for their fervent dedication,
but the extent of the Black Templars' faith is often described as
fanatical. They seek nothing less than to crush every last enemy
of mankind. They have absolutely no tolerance of heretics,
mutants, witches, aliens, or any other abomination against the
Emperor. For ten thousand years they have crusaded to prove
their loyalty, and this creed has become so embedded in their
doctrines that they are utterly ruthless towards anyone or
anything perceived as a threat to the Emperor. They have been
known to mercilessly wipe out entire planetary populations to
expunge the sin of heresy, while the mere presence of a witch
on the battlefield drives them into a zealous fury against which
few enemies have any hope of standing. The Black Templars'
professed loathing of the witch even extends to those psykers
in the employ of the Imperium. Although the Chapter must
utilise astropaths, Navigators, and others with such talents,
the Black Templars are loath to do so, and eschew the use of
librarians in the ranks of the Space Marines.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3>
In battle, the Black Templars seek to continue to fight in the
manner of their founder, Sigismund, preferring close combat over
ranged warfare. Face-to-face with his enemy, a Black Templar
seeks to earn glory and respect and be sure that his foe is truly
vanquished, fighting with righteous fury and the noblest ideals
of honour.<br>
This is truly emphasised by the fanaticism of Black Templar
Battle-Brothers, whose righteous anger makes them loathe to
retreat before an enemy. They will instead drive towards the foe
relentlessly, their own casualties only serving to spur them on still
further, hungry for vengeance on the slayers of their brethren.<br>
Central to each Black Templar's dedication to the Emperor is
the swearing of powerful oaths of faith and protection. On the
eve of battle, it is customary for a Black Templar to renew one of
these vows to the Emperor. The specific vow undertaken focuses
the thoughts of the warrior on a specific aspect of his duties,
encouraging extreme bravery, ruthlessness, and sacred revulsion
of the foe.<br>
Although utterly loyal to the Emperor, the Black Templars
are at the extreme end of independence from the Imperium's
authorities. Some would say the Chapter verges on a rogue
element. The Chapter's fleet-based nature and the goals of
its ten-thousand-year Crusade take the Black Templars
throughout the entire galaxy, and it is primarily the will of
the Marshals that drives the Crusades ever onwards. Like all
Space Marines, the Black Templars do not consider themselves
subject to the rule of the Imperium's power structures, and
each Crusade is effectively an autonomous fighting force,
though they may choose to respond to requests for aid by
others in the vicinity.<br>
When the Crusade fleet makes war upon the foes of the
Emperor, there are two main tactics the Black Templars use
to destroy the enemy. The most brutal is the orbital assault,
known to the few that have survived it as “death from
above.” The Black Templars drop into action in the wake
of a devastating orbital bombardment, using drop pods and
Thunderhawk gunships. With paralysing suddenness, the
Space Marines surgically destroy their targets, leaving the
enemy leaderless and disorganised, incapable of anything
more than surrender or flight.<br>
If the Crusade is able to land heavy equipment, an equally
destructive tactic is the armoured spearhead. Indeed, the Land
Raider Crusader, a war machine that excels in the role of linebreaker,
first saw service with the Chapter. Manoeuvring at
speed, behind a far-ranging screen of bikes and land speeders,
the Black Templars smash their powerful tanks unerringly
through the weak link in the enemy army, armoured columns
slashing left and right before eliminating the remaining
enemy strongpoints.",

		["Demeanour", "Zealous is a Demeanour unique to Space
Marines from the Black Templars Chapter. When not
engaged in battle, the brethren of the Black Templars
are invariably to be found preparing for it. They pass
their time in prayer and meditation, or engaged in
exacting training rituals. Those Initiates entrusted
with the training of a Neophyte spend long hours
passing on their knowledge to their young pupil and
supervising endless drills, practice sessions, and trials.
The brethren frequently impose upon themselves many
hardships, foregoing all but the bare necessities in
order to purify themselves in the eyes of the Emperor
and their primarch, and to emulate the example of their
founder Sigismund.<br>
When serving alongside the Battle-Brothers of
other Space Marine Chapters, many Black Templars
prepare themselves through long fasts and week-long
vigils in order to tolerate the presence of Space Marine
librarians. For those who serve in the Deathwatch,
fighting alongside a brother Space Marine who wields
psychic power is a particular hardship, a trial they
must undergo in order to serve the Emperor more fully
and to strike down the hated alien. For this reason,
great care is undertaken when selecting a Black
Templar for secondment to the Deathwatch, for only
a brother able to contain his deep-seated intolerance
will be able to fight to his full capacity. Despite this,
even these individuals are likely to pass every hour
not spent fighting in deep contemplation and prayer,
often cloistering themselves away from their fellow
Deathwatch Space Marines in a personal shrine to the
Emperor, Dorn, and Sigismund."],

Black Templars are filled with a righteous power and hatred
for the witch and heretic even beyond that of the other
Chapters. It is a religious madness that is often expressed
with valour and fearlessness on the battlefield, but it can also
turn the Battle-Brother against all creatures touched with the
psyker’s gift, be they friend or foe.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Fear the Witch):</b> The Battle-Brother is
uncomfortable around psykers and feels their dark powers
crawling on his flesh and burrowing into his brain. All
Fellowship based tests used on characters with psychic
abilities suffer a –20 penalty, as the Battle-Brother’s disquiet
shows through.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Hate the Witch):</b> The Battle-Brother can
scarcely stand the presence of psykers and abhors their sight.
If there is a psyker in the Battle-Brother’s Kill-team (such as
a Librarian Player Character) or he must work with a psyker
ally, his Kill-team’s Cohesion is reduced by 1 (until such time
as the psyker leaves or is killed).<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Kill the Witch):</b> The Battle-Brother cannot
stand any psykers to live and flies into a rage when he sees
them. When fighting enemy psykers, the Battle-Brother must
seek them out (choosing the most obviously powerful first)
and kill them to the exclusion of all other foes. This can be
especially problematic for the Kill-team, should they need to
take a psyker alive."],
