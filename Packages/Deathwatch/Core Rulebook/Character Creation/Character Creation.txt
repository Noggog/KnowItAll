	"content" : "<b>Stage 1: Generate Characteristics</b><br>
Many of the key aspects of your character are defined
in terms of numbers. Some of the most basic of these are
called Characteristics. They represent your Space Marine’s
capabilities, ranging from physical Characteristics such as
Strength and Toughness to mental ones like Intelligence and
Willpower.<br>
• The player begins with a score of 30 in each Characteristic
and may allocate a total of 100 additional points to his
Characteristics, adding no more than 20 to any one
Characteristic. This method generates characters with
slightly lower than average scores.
• All Space Marine characters begin the game with the
Skills, Talents, and Traits listed on page 36 in the Core Rulebookand have already been marked for you on your character sheet(see page 397 in the Core Rulebook).<br>
• All Space Marines have many special implants that give
them special bonuses and abilities which aresummarised on page 16 in the Core Rulebook and detailed on page 36.<br>
• All Space Marines seconded to the Deathwatch begin with
Skills and Talents already marked for you on the character
sheet.<br>
<br>
<b>Stage 2: Select Chapter</b><br>
The next step in creating your character is to determine your
Space Marine’s home Chapter. A Chapter is a self-contained
Space Marine force that has been your character’s home for
decades (if not centuries!). The Imperium is a vast civilisation,
and by the time your character begins his adventures in the
Deathwatch, he has been influenced by many factors, chief
amongst them the beliefs and traditions of his home Chapter.<br>
• Apply your chapters characteristic changes, demeanor, solo and squad mode abilities. <br>
• Each Chapter modifies your character’s Characteristics.<br>
• The culture and gene-seed of a Space Marine’s Chapter
grants him a Solo Mode Ability and 2 Squad Mode Abilities.<br>
• All Space Marines of a particular Chapter possess a
Demeanour that embodies the beliefs and traditions of
that Chapter.<br>
<br>
<b>Stage 3: Select Specialty</b>
Deathwatch has six Specialities: Deathwatch Apothecary, Deathwatch Assault
Marine, Deathwatch Devastator Marine, Deathwatch Librarian,
Deathwatch Tactical Marine, and Deathwatch Techmarine.<br>
• Space Marine characters each have a Speciality that
represents their role in the Kill-team. Choose one.<br>
• Most Specialities include at least one Skill that the Space
Marine gains during character creation.<br>
• Each Speciality has a selection of Special Abilities.
Choose one and note it.<br>
• Some Specialities (such as Librarian and Techmarine)
gain further options from their Special Abilities.<br>
<br>
<b>Stage 4: Movement, Wounds, Fate, and Experience</b><br>
• Determine the Space Marine’s starting wounds by rolling
1d5 and adding 18 to the result.<br>
• Determine the Space Marine’s starting Fate Points by
rolling 1d10. 1-7=3 Fate Points, 8-9=4 Fate Points, 10=5 Fate Points.<br>
• Determine your movement. The Space Marine’s
power armour will increase your Agility Bonus by 1 for
this purpose. Take your Agiligy Bonus plus 1 for your power armor: Half Move=Ag bonus, Full Move=2*Ag Bonus, Charge=3*Ag Bonus, Run=6*Ag Bonus.<br>
• You may now further customise your Space Marine by
spending 1,000 experience points on certain Advances. Your total xp should be 12,000 by the time you start playing. <br>
<br>
<b>Stage 5: Starting Equipment</b><br>
• All Specialities Standard Issue: Astartes power armour,
Astartes bolt pistol, 3 Astartes frag grenades, 3 Astartes
krak grenades, Astartes combat knife, repair cement, one
Chapter Trapping.
• Deathwatch Apothecary Standard Issue: Astartes
bolter with fire selector, reductor and narthecium.
• Deathwatch Assault Marine Standard Issue: Astartes
chainsword, Astartes jump pack.
• Deathwatch Devastator Marine Standard Issue:
Astartes heavy bolter with backpack ammo supply.
• Deathwatch Librarian Standard Issue: Astartes bolter
with fire selector, force weapon.
• Deathwatch Tactical Marine Standard Issue:
Astartes bolter with fire selector, one clip of Special Issue
ammunition (not exceeding 25 Requisition per clip)
per mission. Note that you must still meet the Renown
requirement for this ammunition.
• Deathwatch Techmarine Standard Issue: Astartes bolter
with fire selector, Astartes servo-arm (as a part of his power
armour), and one other Common craftsmanship cybernetic
(chosen at character creation). See the Cybernetics section
for rules on installing further bionics.<br>
<br>
<b>Stage 6: Giving Characters Life</b><br>
Once all the numbers are finished with, it is time to flesh
out your Space Marine. This stage helps you define your
character’s past, temperaments, beliefs, and more. This step
is an important one, as it helps you portray the character
during game play and makes your Space Marine a unique
being, helping to set him apart from others who may fill a
similar niche. During this step, you also select your character’s
Demeanours—strong elements of his personality that define
him as an individual.<br>
• Consider your character’s appearance. What colour is his
hair? Does he have any distinguishing features?<br>
• Before joining the Deathwatch, your Space Marine
performed admirably in the service of his Chapter.
These events are what led to his selection to join the
Deathwatch. Choose or randomly roll for a past history
event from the tables on page 29 in the Core Rulebook.<br>
• Your Space Marine’s power armour has had many owners,
and it may have some particular quirks. Randomly roll
for your power armour’s history and quirks on Table
5–12 on page 162 in the Core Rulebook.<br>
• Answer the questions on page 31 in the Core Rulebook to flesh out the
personality of your Space Marine.<br>
• Choose a personal Demeanour on page 32 in the Core Rulebook that best fits your
character. Your personal Demeanour may change over
time as your character develops during the game.<br>
• Give your Space Marine a name, either by thinking one
up on your own or choosing one from Table 1–11 on
page 34 in the Core Rulebook or listed with your Chapter's data."
