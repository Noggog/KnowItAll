Adeptus Astartes’ most bitter foe: Chaos Space Marines.
Designed to breach power armour of Space Marine calibre,
the core of each round contains a spark of unstable matter
that creates a micro-fission explosion upon detonation. Each
delicately engineered bolt is supremely effective at thwarting
armour and eradicating even the most resilient target, but the
technology needed to imbue a bolt shell with such power
carries great risks.",

its Penetration increases to 9. Vengeance rounds detonate
prematurely on an attack roll of 91–100. When this happens,
the firer suffers explosive damage equal to the weapon’s
damage with a Penetration of 5 to an arm location (the arm
holding the weapon if it was fired one-handed, or a random
arm if fired with two hands). This automatically causes the
weapon to Jam, and happens too quickly to avoid the damage
by dropping the weapon."]
