	"content" : "Many weapons require larger ammunition sources to function
during extended battles. A backpack supply fits over the standard
backpack power unit on Astartes power armour. For energy
weapons, the supply is a massive battery or charge-unit. For
flame and plasma weapons, it consists of volatile fuel tanks or
canisters. Other ammunition packs are simply stacks of regular
rounds with a feeder line that links into the weapon. Backpack
supplies hold 100 rounds of ammunition for Plasma, Melta, and
Las weapons, 250 rounds of ammunition for SP or Bolt weapons,
and 75 shots for Flame weapons. A weapon connected to a
backpack supply uses that supply for its ammunition and ignores
its normal clip size. Backpack Ammo/Power supplies weigh 40
kg and are automatically issued with any heavy weapon.",
