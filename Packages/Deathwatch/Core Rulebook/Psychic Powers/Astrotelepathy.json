	"content" : "Librarians can use their gifts to send psychic
messages and communications across the vastness of the void in
the same manner as an Astropath. It is however a task which is
undertaken sparingly, as like much of the rest of the Imperium's
forces Space Marines make extensive use of Astropaths,
reserving their gifted Battle-Brothers for more vital tasks.<br>
Any Librarian can use Astrotelepathy, provided he has
enough time and skill—sending a message across the stars
though is a far cry from communicating with someone on the
same world or even a vessel in orbit. To send a message the
Librarian must have at least one power from the Telepathy
Discipline. It requires one full round to activate for every 10
words or one image it contains and uses Willpower for its
Focus Power Test. The range is based on the Librarian's Psy
Rating (see below).<br>
Typically only other Astropaths or Librarians will be able
to receive the message and unless the Librarian has a specific
recipient in mind the GM may have a chance of it reaching
the wrong ears...",
