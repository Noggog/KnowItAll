	"content" : "The Security Skill is used to bypass mechanical locks and other
physical security systems. This differs from many systems that
employ codes or cogitators that are more suited to the Tech-
Use Skill. The GM sets the difficulty of the test according to
the complexity of the mechanism. In most cases one test is
sufficient, but large, intricate systems may require Extended
Tests. See the Tech-Use Skill for systems that combine both
mechanical and technical challenges. Using this Skill without
proper tools or equipment is extremely challenging, and any
attempt to bypass a lock or other security system without
using a multikey or other set of appropriate tools suffers a
-20 penalty.

<b>Special uses<br>
Strategic Entry<br></b>
Although the Security Skill generally focuses on the tactical
aspects of defeating a system, it also has its uses in finding
weak points in the defensive system involved. Careful study of
a building might reveal that one of the locks is of substandard
quality or that sensors fail to cover the weed-choked culvert
behind the facility. The skill can help determine where to
strike instead of just how. This can also be used to find the
weak spot in one's own defences.<br>
Security Tests made in this manner should test against
Awareness rather than Agility, and requires 1d5 hours. The
GM can adjust the time necessary upward in increments of 1d5
additional hours for particularly large or complex systems.",
