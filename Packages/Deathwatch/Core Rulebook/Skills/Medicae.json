	"content" : "The Medicae Skill helps diagnose and treat injuries by suturing
wounds, applying counterseptic, and use of medical devices such
as the narthecium. On individual patients, Medicae provides first
aid and extended care, for short and long-term treatment. On
larger groups of wounded, Medicae can help save the lives of
those that can be saved and apply the Emperor’s grace to those
who cannot, resulting in fewer overall deaths. It can also help
diagnose widespread medical problems and apply the ounce of
prevention before the pound of cure becomes necessary.

<b>Special uses<br>
First Aid</b><br>
The Medicae Skill performs first aid for the injured, removing
a small amount of damage by suturing lacerations, bandaging
abrasions, and plugging punctures. A successful Medicae Test
removes Damage equal to the character’s Intelligence Bonus
on lightly damaged characters, or 1 Damage from heavily or
critically damaged characters. Performing First Aid is a full
round action. First Aid may only be applied to each wound
once and is a full round action by you and your patient.
<br><b>Extended Care</b><br>
Using the Medicae Skill for extended care speeds the
healing process. The character can properly treat a number
of patients equal to his Intelligence Bonus. Each additional
patient imposes a cumulative –10 penalty to Medicae Tests
to provide extended care. For lightly damaged patients,
make one test at the end of each day. For heavily or critically
damaged patients, test once at the end of each week. Success
allows each patient to remove twice the normal Damage—
removing Critical Damage first—plus 1 additional Damage
for each Degree of Success. Failure does not adversely affect
the character’s patients, who heal at the normal rate. Two or
three Degrees of Failure indicates that all lightly and heavily
damaged patients take 1 Damage each, using sudden death
to resolve any Critical Damage (see page 250). Four or more
Degrees of Failure indicates all patients take 1d10 Damage,
using sudden death to resolve Critical Damage.
For additional information on Healing, see Chapter VIII:
Combat.
<br><b>Diagnose</b><br>
The Medicae Skill can also be used to diagnose disease and
other ailments, both on one’s fellow characters and also
on the crew at large. On individuals, a successful Skill Test
yields the name of the ailment and basic treatments. When
used on groups, a successful Skill Test prevents casualties to
the Crew Population due to disease or malnutrition due to
extended voyages.
<br><b>Harvest Gene-Seed</b><br>
As part of an Apothecary’s battlefield duties, he trains in the
use of harvesting the gene-seeds of his fallen brothers. An
Apothecary may use this Skill to extract the gene-seed from
a fallen Space Marine with the use of a narthecium (See page
271 for details).",
