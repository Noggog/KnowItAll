	"content" : "Forbidden Lore skills represent knowledge usually hidden,
veiled, or proscribed by an organisation or society. Mere
possession of this knowledge may cause difficulties for those
not associated with the group in question. Excessive knowledge
of the hidden truths of the Traitor Legions, for example, can
be decidedly bad for one's health for those outside (or even
inside) the Adeptus Astartes. A successful Forbidden Lore Test
indicates the character recalls basic information about the
subject. The GM reveals additional information as appropriate
to the Degree of Success on the roll.<br>
<b>Adeptus Astartes:</b> Extensive knowledge of the practices,
organisation, and homeworlds of the Imperial Space Marines
and their Chapters, including hints and rumours of their myriad
of secret rituals and methods of recruitment and training.

followers of the Machine God, including such things as their
rituals, observances, common beliefs, core philosophies, and
specific knowledge of the Universal Laws.
<br><b>Archeotech:</b> Knowledge of the great, lost tech devices
of past times and clues to their mysterious functions
and purposes.<br>
<b>The Black Library:</b> Secret knowledge concerning the
Black Library, its forbidden contents, horrific guardians, and

<b>Daemonology:</b> The crawling information about some of
the most infamous warp entities and their twisted physical
manifestations.<br>
<b>Heresy:</b> Wisdom concerning acts and practices deemed
heretical by the Imperium, the most contemptible heretics of
history, and their acts.<br>
<b>The Inquisition:</b> An understanding of the secretive
organisation of the Imperium, its common tenets, and
famous Inquisitors.<br>
<b>Mutants:</b> The study of stable and unstable mutations
within humanity, their cancerous development over time, and
some of the studies and books on the topic.<br>
<b>Pykers:</b> Skill in identifying psykers, the physical effects
of their powers, the danger they cause, and the general extent
of their capabilities.<br>
<b>The Traitor Legions:</b> The secrets of the lost Space Marine
Legions, their names, and the sad tale of their fall from grace.
<b>The Warp:</b> An understanding of the energy of the warp, its
