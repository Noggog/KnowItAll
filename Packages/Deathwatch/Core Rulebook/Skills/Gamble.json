	"content" : "The character uses the Gamble Skill when participating in
games of chance and the countless other games popular
amongst soldiers across the Imperium. Each participant wagers
an amount, though these are typically the same, and makes
an Opposed Test with the Gamble Skill. The player with the
most Degrees of Success or fewest Degrees of Failure wins
the pot. The character may choose to lose against any player
with a worse result as part of a Deceive attempt.
Those with both Skills may use Sleight of Hand instead
of Gamble to hide cards or alter dice rolls. Success gives this
character a +20 bonus to his tests, but four or more Degrees
of Failure indicates he has been caught in the act.
