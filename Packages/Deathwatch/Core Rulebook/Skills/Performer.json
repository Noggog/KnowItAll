<b>Special uses<br>
Charming Performance</b><br>
A character may make a Difficult (-10) Performer (Storyteller)
or Performer (Singer) Test instead of a Charm test, to win
round an audience, causing their disposition to improve by
one level (see page 276).
<br><b>Enthralling Performance</b><br>
A character may make a Difficult (-10) Performer (Musician)
or Performer (Singer) Test instead of a Blather Test, utterly
enthralling and distracting an audience for a moment. When
used in place of the Blather Skill, it is subject to the same
rules and conditions.
<br><b>Rousing Tale</b><br>
A character may make a Challenging (+0) Performer
(Storyteller) or Performer (Singer) Test instead of a Command
test to raise the moral of troops under his command or get them
to undertake a difficult duty, such as making a last stand.",
