	"content" : "With the Tracking Skill, the character can follow the
signs left by his quarry, allowing him to hunt them down.
Following obvious tracks does not require a Skill Test, and is
considered part of a character's movement. In instances where
the time or elements have eroded the signs or where the very
environment makes seeing them difficult, such as darkness
or fog, Tracking Tests are required. The difficulty depends
on the condition of the traces and the tracker's surroundings.
When following any tracks where the difficulty of the test
is more than Challenging (+0), the tracker's Movement rate
drops to half. Cunning or devious quarry may attempt to
conceal or erase their tracks. In any case where an opponent
has attempted to do this, make an Opposed Test made against
the prey's Concealment.",
