	"content" : "Acrobatics training supplements the character's natural agility
in attempting types of movement the less athletic would not
even consider. Leaping between the spires of an Imperial
cathedral, jumping over the heads of shorter foes and falling
with grace all become possible. The difficulty of the test
depends on the difficulty of the feat involved: dodging around
the legs of an enraged Ork and leaping from stone to stone
in a swirling magma flow would both present significant
challenges. The more degrees of success obtained, the more
stylish or dramatic the end result.

<b>Special uses</b><br>
<b>Disengage</b><br>
When taking the Disengage Action in combat (see page 239),
the character may make a Challenging (+0) Acrobatics Test
to reduce it to a Half Action.<br><br>
<b>Jump And Leap</b><br>
An Acrobatics Test may substitute for an Agility Test when
jumping or a Strength Test when leaping, according to the
appropriate rules on page 207.
