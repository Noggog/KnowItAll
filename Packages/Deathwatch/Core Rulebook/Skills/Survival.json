	"content" : "The Survival Skill allows the character to endure prolonged
periods in unusual or alien environments. Space Marines
do not die of exposure to the elements, and their implants
allow them to survive on even the most inedible of flora and
fauna. Thus, the Survival Skill most often applies to normal
humans or those Space Marines who learned this skill before
becoming an Initiate in their Chapter. A skilled outdoorsman,
the character can find edible plants, hunt for game, and
determine if food is safe for consumption. He can also
construct viable shelters from native materials or improvised
substances and ensure they're located away from flood chutes
or the territory of predators. The difficulty of these tests
depends on the location: barren deserts provide much greater
challenge than the verdant tropical forests. This skill can also
apply to man-made environments, such as artificial worlds,
the depths of the underhive, or the belly of massive starships.
In this case, the Skill can provide safe resting areas away from
plasma venting and knowledge about which sacred unguents
also provide minimal nutrition.",
