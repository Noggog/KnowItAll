	"content" : "Awareness encompasses the character's subconscious ability 
to react to things his conscious mind may not perceive. 
He can use this Skill to notice threats—such as ambushes, 
traps or cleverly hidden objects—or slight changes in the 
environment—such as a faint vibration of a far off Ork 
Squiggoth or the foul smell of a Daemonhost. When using 
Awareness against an opponent, the test is always opposed. 
This use includes noticing ambushes, spotting traps, and 
other things involving another's actions. However, noticing 
environmental factors is a standard test. This use includes 
perceiving trace scents, motion, or similar things.",
