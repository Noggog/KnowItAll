	"content" : "The Carouse Skill is used to resist the effects of alcohol and
narcotics. Frequent imbibers can build up quite a tolerance to
alcohols and other drugs, remaining clear-headed and lucid
while those across the table find their judgement or capabilities
diminished. The character makes a Skill Test whenever he
suffers the effects of alcohol or similar intoxicants (naturally,
for Space Marines, this requires imbibing of truly prodigious
amounts or toxicity!). Each time he would otherwise suffer
from the effects of an intoxicant, make a Carouse Test. Failure
indicates he gains a level of Fatigue or suffers the side effects
of the substance. Should the character lose consciousness, he
remains passed out for a number of hours equal to 1d10 minus
his Toughness Bonus (minimum 1 hour).",
