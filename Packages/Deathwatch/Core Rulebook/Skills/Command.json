	"content" : "The character uses the Command Skill to both direct those
under his authority and establish actions for groups to execute
on command, such as launching an assault or ordering a
regroup. This Skill is only effective upon those under the
character's authority. A successful Command Test indicates
that those whom he directs follow his instructions in a timely
manner. Failure on the Skill Test when used on an individual
simply means that he does not follow the character's directions,
though additional Degrees of Failure can indicate that the
underling accepts the task with no intention of actually doing
it, or that he misinterprets the command or takes contradictory
actions. For directing groups, Degrees of Success or Failure
increase or decrease the time necessary to execute the orders,
with three or more Degrees of Failure subjecting them to
confused inaction. A Command Test can affect a number of
targets equal to the character's Fellowship Bonus. The targets 
must be able to see and hear the character—though this could
be done remotely through a vox or pict-caster—and speak a
common language.<br>
<br><b>Special uses
<br>Extend Support Range</b><br>
As a Half Action the Battle-Brother nominated as the squad's
leader (see page 238) may extend his Kill-team's Support
Range (see page 213) by a number of metres equal to his
Fellowship Bonus. For this Skill to work the Battle-Brother
must be either within visual or vocal range of his Kill-team.
This extension lasts until the start of the Battle-Brother's
next turn.",
