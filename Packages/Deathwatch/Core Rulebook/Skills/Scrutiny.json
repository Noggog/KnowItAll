	"content" : "The Scrutiny Skill helps assess the people or objects
encountered in the game. The character uses it to determine
an individual's truthfulness, his motives, personality, and
temperament. It can also be used to examine an object in
detail, noticing small details and characteristics that might
pass unseen in a casual inspection. Scrutiny is an Opposed
Test against the target's Deceive when trying to perceive
falsehoods, or some other deceptions. However, Scrutiny
does not reveal hidden secrets or a target's carefully concealed
intent, and should never replace good roleplaying in an
interactive situation. This skill counters the Opposed Tests of
many manipulative Interaction skills, such as Charm, Deceive,
and Intimidate.",
