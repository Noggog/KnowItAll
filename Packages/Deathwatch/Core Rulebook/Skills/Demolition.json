	"content" : "The character can use the Demolition Skill to employ
explosives in the proper quantity to achieve a desired effect,
from cutting through the hatch of a Land Raider to destroying
a plasma conduit without significantly damaging the reactor
behind it. It can also be used to defuse explosives left by
others or to manufacture demolition materials, from slow
fuses to blasting caps to the explosives themselves. This Skill
pertains to set charges rather than grenades and other devices
intended for use against the enemy in combat.

<b>Special uses<br>
Manufacture Explosives</b><br>
Much like the Trade Skills, Demolition Skill allows the
character to make explosive materials from basic components.
This use of the Demolition Skill is an Extended Test, and
the GM assigns a difficulty and duration in accordance with
the complexity of the compound and the materials at hand.
Constructing breaching charges in a well-stocked munitorum
warehouse is far easier than making a fuse from dried vines
and droppings.<br>
<b>Place Explosives</b><br>
The effectiveness of explosive devices is greatly dependent
upon the skill with which they are placed. Success on a
Demolitions Test indicates the character has successfully
planted the explosive charge, set with his trigger of choice.
Possible triggers are only limited by the imagination, and
can include trip wires, timers, proximity sensors, or remote
activators. Failure indicates that the explosives fail to go off
when triggered, though the character will not know this until
the time of activation. Four or more Degrees of Failure indicate
the device explodes as the character is manipulating it, with
suitably lethal results. Some tasks, such as rigging a building
for demolition or bringing down a massive suspension bridge,
require an Extended Test. The GM sets difficulty and duration
depending on the extent of the undertaking. When placing
explosives, make sure to note the total Degrees of Success and
the die roll, as it may be used in an Opposed Test if someone
attempts to defuse the character's hard work.
<br><b>Defuse Explosives</b><br>
Defusing charges also falls under the Demolition Skill. Make
an Opposed Test against the Demolition Skill of the individual
who sets the explosives. Winning the test indicates that the
bomb has been defused. Simple failure means that while the
charge has not been disarmed, neither has it gone off. Four or
more Degrees of Failure indicate the character has set off the
device, suffering the consequences of the explosion. Defusing
multiple charges or complex trigger mechanisms may require
an Extended Test as determined by the GM.",
