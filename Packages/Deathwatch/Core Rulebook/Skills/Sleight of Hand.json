	"content" : "Characters use Sleight of Hand for any task requiring a
combination of deception and dexterity. Examples include
palming small objects, picking pockets, or performing tricks.
The GM sets the difficulty for the test according to the size of
the object and the intensity of observation. Sleight of Hand
is always an Opposed Test against the opponent's Awareness
or Scrutiny.<br>
The character can use Sleight of Hand instead of Gamble
to employ deception and alter the odds in games of chance.
See the Gamble Skill for more information. Though Sleight
of Hand usually requires a Half Action, the character may
make a test as a Free Action with a -10 penalty.",
