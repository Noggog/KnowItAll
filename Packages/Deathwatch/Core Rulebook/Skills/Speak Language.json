	"content" : "The Speak Language Skill is used to communicate with others
using the same language. The Imperium has nearly as many
languages as it has star systems, but for all this variety, most
can speak or understand a variation of Low Gothic. In most
situations, Skill Tests are unnecessary so long as those involved
all speak a common tongue. However, communication with
those using obscure dialects or cryptic, complex concepts
requires a test at an appropriate difficulty.
<br><b>Eldar:</b> Though no human can hope to capture the subtle
nuances and sub-tones of this extremely complex and ancient
language, it is enough to make one’s meaning clear.
<br><b>High Gothic:</b> The official language of the Imperium, used
by Imperial officials, nobility, members of the Ecclesiarchy,
and those involved in high-level negotiations.
<br><b>Kroot:</b> The native chirping language of the Kroot is
almost impossible for a human to emulate, however, with
training and a good ear, it can be understood.
<br><b>Low Gothic:</b> The common tongue of the Imperium, used
by the countless millions of ordinary citizens.
<br><b>Ork:</b> More grunts and physical violence than an actual
language, it is possible for humans to speak and understand
it, though it is doubtful they would be able to survive a
conversation.
<br><b>Techna-Lingua:</b> The official language of the Adeptus
Mechanicus, this binary language has been optimised for rapid
communication of technical data and servitor commands.
<br><b>Tau:</b> The language of the Tau Empire, spoken by the Tau
themselves and shared by their multitude of alien subjects.
<br><b>Skill Groups:</b> Eldar, High Gothic, Kroot, Low Gothic, Ork,
Techna-Lingua, Tau",
