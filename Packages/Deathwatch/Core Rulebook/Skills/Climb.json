	"content" : "With the Climb Skill the character can ascend or descend
ropes, pipes, scaffolding, and both natural and man-made
walls. This Skill is not used for ladders or other easily ascended
ways, but for climbs without ready handholds or other poor
climbing conditions. The condition of the surface or item
and the environmental conditions can impose additional
bonuses or penalties. It is far more difficult to ascend an icy
rock face in a blizzard than the outer shell of a hive that is
crisscrossed with pipes and conduits. A successful test allows
the character to ascend or descend at one-half his half move
rate. See Climbing in Chapter VII: Playing the Game for
more details.",
