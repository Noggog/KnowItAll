	"content" : "Scholastic Lore grants the character knowledge of a
particularly complex or esoteric subject. A successful Skill
Test allows the character to recall necessary information or
research a particular subject if appropriate reference material is
readily available. Scholastic Lore grants a depth of knowledge
far beyond that of Common Lore, requiring both experience
and study to obtain. Scholastic Lore Tests can identify things
that fall within the character’s area of expertise, such as a
person, book, starship, or machine spirit. A successful Skill
Test within the realm of the character’s speciality reveals basic
information about the object in question in accordance with Table 3–3: Scholastic Lore.

<b>Table 3–3: Scholastic Lore.
Scholastic Lore Degrees of Success</b>
Standard Success: Reveals basic information known
to scholars on the topic.<br>
One: Reveals uncommon information,
known to few dedicated academics.<br>
Two: Reveals obscure information,
known to only serious scholars.<br>
Three or more: Reveals extremely obscure
information, known only to true
experts in the field.
<br>

Scholastic Lore can overlap with Common Lore and
Forbidden Lore in some areas, but it represents more indepth—
and academic—information. A character with
Common Lore (Imperial Creed) might know conventional
information about the Cult of the Emperor and its various
organisations and their practices within the Imperium, but
one with Scholastic Lore (Imperial Creed) would be able to
name the various cults within a subsector and their varying
levels of divergence from the Ministorum. Scholastic Lore
Tests require no time, as the character either knows the fact
or not. Researching, however, requires an Extended Test of a
duration and difficulty appropriate to the task at hand.
