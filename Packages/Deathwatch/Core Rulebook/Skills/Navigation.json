	"content" : "The character uses the Navigation Skill to plot a course
between two points. The course might be across a continent or
across a star system. A successful Navigation Test also provides
an estimated travel time based on geography, cosmography,
prevailing conditions, weather, and solar winds. Surface
navigation is used to navigate across a planet’s surface, using
logi-compasses, map readouts, and geographical knowledge.
Stellar navigation is used to navigate in space between planets,
using star-charts, and carto-mantic rituals. A Navigation Test
represents several hours of charting courses, consulting maps,
and making necessary trajectory corrections. However, 1
minute is adequate for the purpose of finding the character’s
current location.
