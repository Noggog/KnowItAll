	"content" : "Tactics is the practical application of military knowledge in
the field of battle. It differs from the various Lore Skills in
that it relates directly to on the ground combat manoeuvres
and actions rather than a broad theoretical or strategic view
of warfare. It also differs from the Command Skill in that
Command allows the direction of troops but does not grant
any special knowledge in how best to use them. A character
can use Tactics at any time when he wants to determine the
best military course of action in a combat. This could be
anything from the best position to suppress an entrenched
enemy before an assault to picking a good landing zone
when coming in under fire. Failing a Tactics (Assault) Test, for
example, might mean facing a concentration of a defending
force or hitting a stronger line of fortifications.
<br><b>Air Combat:<b> Covers atmosphere and near-orbit
engagements with air superiority fighters as well as close
support and bombing with ground attack aircraft.
<br><b>Armoured Tactics:<b> An understanding of armoured
warfare, how best to use armour, as well as how best to
exploit the weaknesses of such vehicles.
<br><b>Assault Doctrine:<b> Covers all kinds of assaults, from
charging a bunker to opposed amphibious landings.
<br><b>Defensive Doctrine:<b> How to set up a good defensive
line, including layering units, creating areas of enfilading fire,
and good clear kill zones.
<br><b>Orbital Drop Procedures:<b> A knowledge of orbital drop
doctrine and how to use it to maximise troop concentration
and ensure shock and awe in the enemy.
<br><b>Recon and Stealth:<b> An understanding of the best methods
of recon and stealth, such as how to approach a defensive
position unseen or quietly destroy sentry positions.
<br><b>Void Combat:<b> Covers starship combat between anything
from lightly armoured escorts up to battle barges and space
hulks. It is also includes knowledge of high orbit fire support
doctrines and the best way to use ships in orbit to aid
ground troops.
<br><br><b>Special uses
<br>Ambush</b><br>
A character in the role of Kill-team leader may use Tactics
(Recon and Stealth) in the place of an opposed Concealment
for himself or any member of his squad provided they are in
Support Range (see page 213).",
