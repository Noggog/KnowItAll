	"content" : "The Common Lore skill allows the character to recall general
information, procedures, divisions, traditions, famed individuals,
and superstitions of a particular world, group, organisation, or
race. This skill differs from Scholastic Lore, which represents
scholarly learning, and Forbidden Lore, which involves hidden
or proscribed knowledge, in that it deals with basic information
learned from prolonged exposure to a culture or area.
