	"content" : "The Deceive Skill enables the character to mislead others as
to his true intent. Any time he tells a lie, reveals only part
of the truth, or spins information to his advantage with the
intent to mislead someone, the character makes a Deceive
Test. He need not make a Deceive Test every time he tells a
lie, but only when that deception would change someone’s
mind, opinion, or actions. Deceive is always an Opposed Test,
using the character’s Deceive Skill against his opponent’s
Scrutiny. A Deceive Test affects a number of targets equal to
the character’s Fellowship Bonus. They must be able to see
and hear the character clearly, either in person or via vox or
pict-caster. They must also speak a common language.",
