value, strength, or manufacture of an object or group of items.
Thus, the Skill can be used on anything from a single power
sword to a fortified bunker. Before evaluating an object,
the character must specify what he is trying to determine:
its approximate monetary value, its quality and strength, or
its origin. Success on the Evaluate Test reveals the relevant
information in a broad sense, such as its value in Throne Gelt,
its Craftsmanship (see page 140) and structural integrity,
or its make or model. Additional Degrees of Success gives
additional information about the object. A failed test results
in false information about the object, with the degree of error
increasing with each Degree of Failure. The GM should roll
Evaluate Tests and only reveal what the character believes to
be true. The difficulty of the test should be adjusted for the
character's access to the item and any relevant Lore or Trade
Skills related to the item. Using Evaluate on large or numerous
objects requires an Extended Test, though the character can
appraise a single item in about a minute.

<b>Special uses<br>
Weak Points</b><br>
When making an attack against a heavily armoured stationary
target such as a bunker or pillbox, a character may use
Evaluate to determine weak points by making a Challenging
(+0) Evaluate Test. Success adds an additional +4 to the Pen
of the character's weapon for his next attack if it is made
against the target. Each additional Degree of Success adds a
further +4 points of Pen. This is a Full Action.
<br><b>Solid Cover</b><br>
When in cover, a character can make a Challenging (+0)
Evaluate Test to find the cover's strongest point. Success adds
an additional +4 AP to the cover (for the character only) with
each additional Degree of Success adding another +4 AP.
This is a Half Action.
