Under normal conditions, piloting does not require a test,
but unusual or difficult conditions such as storms, obstacles
or dangerous manoeuvres do require a Skill Test. When
chasing another vehicle or ship or contesting for position, the
character makes an opposed Pilot Test against his opponent.
