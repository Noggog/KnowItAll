	"content" : "The character can use the Inquiry Skill to gain information
by asking questions, making conversation, or simple
eavesdropping. Inquiry allows the character to pick up general
information about an area: its news, recent events, and more.
Additional Degrees of Success reveal more detailed or more
secretive tidings. Inquiry can also be used as an Investigation
Skill, allowing the character to hunt after a particular item of
information from either individuals or resources, such as the
Chapter's librarium. This use is virtually always an Extended
Test, with difficulty and duration set by the GM.
