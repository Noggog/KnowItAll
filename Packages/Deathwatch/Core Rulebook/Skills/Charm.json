	"content" : "The character can use Charm Skill to improve the disposition
of others towards him, making a Charm Test whenever he
wishes to change the minds of an individual or small group.
The character need not make a Charm Test each time he speaks
with others in a pleasant manner, but only when he wishes
to change their opinion or disposition, or convince them to
do something. All Charm Tests are opposed by Willpower
and can affect a number of targets equal to the character’s
Fellowship Bonus. The targets must be able to see and hear
the character clearly, and share a common language.
<br>
<br>
<b>Special uses</b><br>
<b>Inspire</b><br>
Those in a position of authority can use the Charm Skill to
inspire a group-related test, either with positive or negative
reinforcement. Success provides a +10 bonus to the next
Characteristic Test of the motivated group, such as passing a
Willpower Test to resist Fear or recover from Pinning. Thus, a
Battle-Brother might inspire lesser Imperial troopers to fight
harder, or the Kill-team’s Brother-Chaplain might rouse his
brothers with an impassioned prayer to the Emperor.",
