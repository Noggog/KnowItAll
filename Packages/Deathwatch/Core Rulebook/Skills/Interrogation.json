	"content" : "The Interrogation skill allows the character to extract
information from an unwilling subject. The application differs
from torture, where a subject will frequently say anything
to stop the ordeal. Rather, interrogation represents skilled
application of psychology, various devices, serums, and other
techniques. The GM may modify the difficulty of the test
according to the availability of tools, facilities, and other
conditions. Interrogation is always an Opposed Test, pitting
the character’s Interrogation Skill against an opponent’s
Willpower. If the interrogator wins the Opposed Test, he gets
one answer plus one answer for each Degree of Success. If the
victim wins the Opposed Test, the interrogator get nothing
of worth. Two or more Degrees of Failure inflict 1d10 plus
the interrogator’s Willpower Bonus in damage against the
victim and prevents any further interrogation for 1d5 days.
If the interrogator suffers four or more Degrees of Failure,
the victim takes the same damage and gains a +30 bonus to
Willpower Tests made to resist Interrogation at the hands of
the interrogator or his allies. Each Interrogation Test inflicts
one level of Fatigue on the target.",
