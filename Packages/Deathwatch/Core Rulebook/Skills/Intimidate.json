	"content" : "The character uses Intimidate Tests to pressure individuals
to give in to his demands. The character does not make an
Intimidate Test every time he makes a threat, but only when
it involves coercion. Though Intimidate lists Strength as its
associated Characteristic, the character may substitute either
Intelligence or Fellowship if the threat involves more subtle
methods than brute force, such as blackmail or humiliation. An
Intimidate Test affects a number of targets equal to the character’s
Strength, Intelligence, or Fellowship Bonus, depending on the
characteristic used for the test. The targets must be able to see
and hear the character clearly, either in person or via pict or
vox-caster, and speak a common language.

<b>Special uses<br>
War Cry</b><br>
As part of a Charge Action a character may use the Intimidate
skill to make a war cry. This is a Free Action that targets the
recipient or recipients of the character’s charge—i.e. those he
will end up in combat with and make melee attacks against.
The character then makes an Intimidate Test, based on
Strength, opposed by the target’s Willpower. If the character
is successful, the target suffers –10 to all Parry and Dodge
tests against the charging character.
Creatures immune to the effects of Fear and other mindeffecting
psychology are immune to the effects of a war cry.",
