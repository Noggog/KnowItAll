	"content" : "Tech-Use allows the character to use or repair complex
mechanical items or fathom the workings of unknown
technical artefacts. Using a basic piece of equipment under
typical circumstances requires no test, such as using a voxcaster
or opening a shuttle hatch. Tech-Use Tests are necessary
for unusual or unfamiliar gear, malfunctioning or broken
items, and any situation where conditions are less than ideal,
such as attempting to use the same vox-caster near a plasma
core or coaxing the machine spirit of a strange vessel’s warp
drive to reignite its fires. The character can also use Tech-
Use to repair damaged or defective items, using an Extended
Test of duration and difficulty set by the GM depending on
the item’s complexity and the extent of the damage. Tech-
Use does not include building an item from scratch, which
requires the relevant Trade Skill.<br>
A Tech-Use Test to determine the function of a complex
system takes 1 minute, but the GM may adjust this
depending on the complexity. Tests made to repair items are
Extended Tests, the duration of which depends upon its size
and complexity.

<b>Special uses<br>
Security Systems<br></b>
The Security Skill covers mechanical security systems,
but many systems may have both physical and electronic
components, and certain examples may be entirely controlled
by cogitators and machine spirits. The GM determines the
necessary Skill Tests required for a particular system, which
may include a combination of both Skills, or may involve a
single roll with an appropriate modifier for possessing both
Skills, or lacking one or the other.",
