{
	"content" : "Characters with the Contortionist Skill can make use of their
innate flexibility, double joints, or even selective dislocation
of joints, to allow them to escape bonds, squeeze through
openings normally too small for passage, or fit into an
area normally too small for their body. It also provides an
alternative to brute strength in grappling.<br><br>

<b>Special uses<br>
Escape Bonds<br></b>
The character can make a Contortionist Test to slip free
of bonds. This is an Opposed Test, using the character’s
Contortionist Skill against his opponent’s Characteristic Test
using Intelligence.<br>
The quality of the bonds and the time used to employ
them affects the difficulty of the test. It may be impossible to
escape adamantine manacles properly employed by a bounty
hunter, but far easier to slip out of the crude ropes hastily
applied by a feral tribesman—especially after applying grox
fat to one’s wrists. Escaping bonds requires 1 minute, with
each Degree of Success reducing this time by 10 seconds.<br>
<b>Escape Grapple</b><br>
After an opponent has grappled the character in combat, he
may escape using the Contortionist Skill. Make an Opposed
Test with the character’s Contortionist Skill against the
grappler’s Strength Characteristic. Success indicates the
character has slipped out of his enemy’s hands and is free.
Failure means he remains grappled.<br>
<b>Squeeze Through</b><br>
The character can make a Contortionist Test to squeeze
through a tight space, such as through a maintenance conduit
aboard a ship or a gap in damaged blast doors. The character
can also use this aspect of the Skill to cram himself into a space
normally too small to fit his body. The GM sets the difficulty
of the test according to the size of the passage or opening,
is well within his rights to rule that some spaces are simply
too small to allow use of this Skill. A successful Skill Test
indicates that the character has managed to squirm through
the gap or into the crate. Failure means that he cannot pass
the area or fit into the space. Four or more Degrees of Failure
means the character has become stuck until he can succeed
in another Contortionist Test or someone else pulls him free
of the embarrassing predicament. Squeeze Through takes 1
minute, with each Degree of Success reducing this time by
10 seconds.",
