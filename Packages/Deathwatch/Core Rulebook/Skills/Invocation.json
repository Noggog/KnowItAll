	"content" : "For the duration of the
Round, the character clears his mind of external influence and
focuses his will more intently. This may be through recitation
of mantras, use of psychic foci, or meditation. A successful
test indicates that the character's mind is ready to channel a
greater amount of the warp than usual, while still limiting his
exposure. On the next Round, the character adds +1 to the
final Psy Rating of any Fettered Power Test.
Failure on the Invocation Test indicates that the character's
attempts to focus have backfired, and he must take a -1
penalty to the final Psy Rating of a Fettered Power Test. If this
reduces the Psy Rating to zero, the power fails to activate.",
