	"content" : "Shadowing allows the character to follow others, either on
foot, in vehicles, and even aboard shuttles and starships. It
contrasts with Concealment because it involves movement
and blending into one’s surroundings. On foot, it might
involve using physical cover or the press of bodies in a crowd;
in a vehicle, techniques might include false turns or using a
nearby cargo hauler as cover; aboard ships, it can entail the
use of asteroids or other stellar objects or busy space lanes
around major systems. Shadowing Tests are always Opposed
Tests against the opponent’s Awareness or Scrutiny Skill. A
single Shadowing Test is sufficient to follow the opponent
unseen for 1 minute.",
