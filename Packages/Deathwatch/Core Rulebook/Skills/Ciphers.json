	"content" : "Many groups and organisations employ ciphers as a secret
shorthand code in communicating basic ideas, warnings, or
information rapidly. The character can use and understand the
signals, physical markings, or other subtle signs employed to
express these concepts. Ciphers tend to express simple concepts
or messages, such as warning of danger, marking a target, or
indicating ownership. Skill Tests are not required to either
leave or read basic messages but are necessary to communicate
or decipher complicated meanings or signs obscured by the
passage of time.

<b>Skill Groups<br>
Xenos Markings:</b> Many aliens, such as Orks, make
extensive use of symbolism and icons. Understanding these
markings allows a broad understanding of their meaning, such
as where a tribe has marked its boundaries or areas they have
marked as dangerous.<br>
<b>Deathwatch:</b> Kill-teams often develop their own shorthand
communication to allow them to converse quickly and
secretively in the presence of others. This is especially useful
when dealing with other arms of the Imperial war machine,
where the goals of the Deathwatch may not coincide with
those of the Imperial Guard or Navy.<br>
<b>Chapter Runes:</b> Each Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes has
its own form of ciphers used to communicate between its Battle-
Brothers. These closely guarded secrets are almost never taught
to those outside the Chapter and constitute a reliable way for
those within the Chapter to quickly identify each other.
<br><b>Imperial Codes:</b> Both the Imperial Navy and the Imperial
Guard employ a battle language which comprises mostly of
numbers and acronyms. Incomprehensible to those who do
not know its meaning, it allows them to quickly signal for
reinforcements, identify enemies, and call down fire support.
<br><b>Inquisition:</b> Used to communicate a private and prearranged
code between given agents of the Inquisition. Note
that these codes are unique to specific Ordos within the
Inquisition. This Skill Group applies to all ciphers used by
acolytes and throne agents of the Inquisition.
<br><b>Mercenary Cant:</b> Many mercenary companies operate
in the Imperium, and each has an abbreviated, clipped battle
language for orders and commands. Though there are some
commonalities, each is essentially unique.
<br><b>Underworld:</b> Crime lords have used ciphers since before
the time of the Emperor, and their sophistication has only
increased over time. Each organisation uses its own to deter
competition.",
