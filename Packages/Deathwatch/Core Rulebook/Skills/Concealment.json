	"content" : "The Concealment Skill is used to hide things, from small
objects to vehicles to starships, even oneself. Use of the Skill
requires an appropriate environment to mask the item in
question, such as buildings and trees for a small shuttle or an
asteroid field or a space anomaly for a starship. Concealment is
always an Opposed Test, pitting the character's Concealment
against his opponent's Awareness or Scrutiny. Thus, the
character only makes the test when someone looks for him.
If the character or the object he intends to hide remains
perfectly still, he gains a +10 bonus to the Skill Test.",
