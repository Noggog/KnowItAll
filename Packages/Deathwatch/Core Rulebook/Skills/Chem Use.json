	"content" : "The Chem-Use Skill allows the character to safely identify,
handle, and prepare a variety of chemicals, toxins, poisons, and
drugs. While Chem-Use covers the use and basic combination
of these substances, the Trade (Chymist) Skill deals with their
manufacture from base components.
Success in a Chem-Use Test, modified by the appropriate
difficulty for the chemical or drug in question, indicates it has
been administered, combined, or otherwise applied correctly,
providing the desired results. Failure on the test indicates the
dose was wasted without effect. See Chapter V: Armoury
for more information on drugs, chemicals, and their effects.
