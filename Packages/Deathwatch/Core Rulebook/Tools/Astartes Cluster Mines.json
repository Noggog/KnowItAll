	"content" : "Cluster mines are designed not just for explosive power, but to
avoid the enemy’s notice until he is blown into tiny bits. Cluster
mines achieve this aim by packing triple-intensity fyceline or
similarly potent explosives into dozens of micro-explosive nodules
that are linked to a single trigger, typically a tripwire or pressure
sensor. The networked explosives have a synergistic effect and
produce a massive blast when detonated.

A standard mine array covers two square metres; this can be
increased by linking multiple mine arrays, but the area’s smallest
dimension must not be less than one metre for the mines to have
their full effect. Cluster mines are designed for even the relatively
green Scout squads to plant without extensive training. When
setting cluster mines, the character makes a Concealment Test,
receiving a +20 bonus if he is also trained in Demolitions. Note
the degrees of success, as any character about to pass through a
mined area Opposes those successes with an Awareness Test. If
the potential victim wins the contest, he may stop short to avoid
the mines. If he fails, he and anyone else in the mined area take
4d10 X Damage with a Penetration of 4.

A successful Demolitions Test while planting mines allows for
more sophisticated trigger techniques such as time-delays. These
booby traps are particularly effective when used to damage the
vulnerable underside of most vehicles. Cluster mines double their
Penetration to any vehicle in their area of effect.",
