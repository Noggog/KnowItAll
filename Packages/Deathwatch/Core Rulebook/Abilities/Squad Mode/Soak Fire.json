	"content" : "While a good formation covers all angles of attack,
it also shields the squad from directed fire. This is especially
true of Space Marines, who use their bulk and armour to shrug
off hails of bullets, bolts, and beams. A Battle-Brother may use
the Soak Fire ability whenever another member of his squad
currently within his Support Range is hit by a Semi or Full
Auto fire attack and would be eligible to make a Dodge Test to
avoid the attack. These hits are then divided evenly between the
original target, the Battle-Brother, and those supporting him,
provided they would normally be eligible targets for the attack.
Regardless of the number of Battle-Brothers soaking fire, the
original target always takes at least one hit. Note that Battle-
Brothers soaking fire cannot Dodge attacks allocated to them.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, both
he and those supporting him may soak single-attack ranged
weapons, such as a blast from a lascannon or a sniper's bullet,
dividing the Damage evenly between those involved.",
