	"content" : "The animalistic nature and fighting style of the Space
Wolves often gives them an edge in close combat where they may
unleash their inner beast against their enemies. While this ability
is in effect, the Battle-Brother and those in Support Range of
him may re-roll all Opposed Tests in grapples, add an additional
+10 to any bonuses for outnumbering foes in hand-to-hand,
and add +10 to Dodge and Parry rolls against melee attacks.<br>

<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, the
bonus to outnumbering and to Dodge rolls increases to +20.",
