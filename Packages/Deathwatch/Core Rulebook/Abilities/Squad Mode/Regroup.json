supporting each other against their foes. As a Full Action,
the Battle-Brother may order a Regroup to allow himself and
those in Support Range of him to move up to twice their
Agility Bonus in any direction, just as if they had made a Full
Move Action. In addition, Regroup move does not trigger
enemy Overwatch or Suppression Fire.<br>

<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, in
addition to this free movement, Battle-Brothers may reload
any weapons they are currently carrying, provided doing so
would only be a Half Action or a Free Action.",
