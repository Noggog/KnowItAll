	"content" : "As small elite infantry squads, Kill-teams are well versed
in the methods of dealing with large, hardened threats like
armour and bunkers. When attacking such enemies, the squad
will typically use some members to draw fire while the others
dispatch it with heavy weapons or demo-packs. The Battle-
Brother may nominate a member of the Kill-team armed with
either a heavy weapon or an explosive (this could be himself)
to initiate a Tank Buster manoeuvre as part of an Attack Action
against an armoured vehicle or fortification. For every member of
the Kill-team in Support Range, the nominated Battle-Brother
may add either +5 to his Ballistic Skill to attack or move 2 metres
closer to his target (if he is trying to plant a charge or grenade).<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, the
nominated Battle-Brother may add +10 to his Ballistic Skill
or move 5 metres closer to his target for every member of the
Kill-team in Support Range.",
