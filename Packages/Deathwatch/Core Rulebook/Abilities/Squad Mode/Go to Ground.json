	"content" : "When subjected to heavy, accurate, and effective fire,
a well-trained squad knows to take cover. As a Reaction, the
Battle-Brother may issue a Go to Ground order when he or
another member of his Kill-team within his Support Range has
been hit by a ranged attack. Both the Battle-Brother and those
in Support Range of him may immediately make a free move
up to their Agility Bonus in metres to find cover. Note that the
effects of the hit are worked out before any Battle-Brothers
may move. In the case of hits from semi or full auto weapons,
only the first hit is worked out before the Battle-Brothers move
and the remaining hits after they have gone to ground.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, the
free move to cover may be up to twice the Battle-Brother’s
Ability Bonus.",
