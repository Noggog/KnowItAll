	"content" : "The Storm Wardens know well the doctrine of strike
first, strike fast and practise this both in personal duels and
their squad tactics. A Battle-Brother of the Storm Wardens
Chapter may order a Lightning Strike at the start of any combat
where neither side is Surprised. The Battle-
Brother and those in Support Range of him immediately gain
a Surprise Round just as if they had Surprised their foes.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 3 or more, in
addition to gaining a Surprise Round, both he and those
supporting him may roll two dice and choose the highest
when determining their Initiative for the following combat.",
