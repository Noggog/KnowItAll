	"content" : "Of all the Chapters, the Ultramarines pride themselves
as among the most loyal and bravest of all the Emperor's
chosen, a fact that they like to impress upon their fellow Battle-
Brothers. While this power is in effect, all Battle-Brothers within Support Range of the Battle-Brother (including the
Battle-Brother himself) gain a bonus on all tests equal to the
Battle-Brother's Fellowship Bonus. In addition, each Round
the Battle-Brother may single out one member of his Kill-team
and grant that character a re-roll on any one test (this re-roll
includes the bonus provided by his Fellowship).<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, the
bonus to tests increases to twice his Fellowship Bonus.",
