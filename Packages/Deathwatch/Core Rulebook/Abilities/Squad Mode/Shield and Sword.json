	"content" : "Many Battle-Brothers of the Storm Wardens Chapter
favour storm shields and power swords and train to fight side
by side with these heavy weapons. The Storm Wardens have
adapted this tactic to other forms of melee combat. While this
ability is in effect, the Battle-Brother and those in Support
Range of him can Parry attacks directed against those by their
side (allies within 2 metres). In addition, any time a Battle-
Brother benefiting from this ability is struck in melee, he may
use his Reaction to make a Standard Attack with a melee
weapon back at the creature that attacked him.
<br><br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 5 or more,
all those affected by this ability gain a +20 bonus to
Parry Tests.",
