	"content" : "Space Wolves are skilled at baiting an opponent or
distracting an enemy at a critical time so that another Space
Wolf can attack unhindered. When a Space Marine attacks a
single target, another Space Marine within support range may
voluntarily give up an unused reaction to distract the target.
If he does so, the first Space Marine’s melee or ranged attacks
against that target may not be parried or dodged this turn.
<br><br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 3 or more,
Melee attack rolls against the target affected by this ability
gain a +10 bonus.",
