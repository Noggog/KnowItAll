their midst and hack them down. Using this ability, the Battle-
Brother and those in Support Range of him may make an
immediate Charge Move and a Standard Attack with a melee
weapon. In addition, such is the fury of such an attack that all
Battle-Brothers involved may re-roll Damage for their attacks.<br>

both he and the Kill-team can make Multiple Attacks instead
of a Standard Attack with their melee weapons.",
