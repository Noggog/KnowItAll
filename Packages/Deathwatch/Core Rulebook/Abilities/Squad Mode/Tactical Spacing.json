	"content" : "Formation and spacing are an important part of a
squad’s function on the battlefield and influence their ability
to warn each other of danger and defend themselves against
attack. While this ability is in effect, the Battle-Brother and
those in Support Range of him can share their Reactions. For
example, one member of the Kill-team could give his Reaction
(losing it for himself for the turn) to another member of the
Kill-team to use. If the Space Marine has extra reactions (such
as the bonus reactions granted from the Step Aside Talent),
these may also be shared.
<br><br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 5 or more, in
addition to being able to share Reactions within the group,
all members gain an additional Reaction while this ability is
in effect.",
