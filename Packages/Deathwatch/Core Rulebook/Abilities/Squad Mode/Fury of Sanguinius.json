	"content" : "The Blood Angels possess a fury on the battlefield
that can turn them into wild beasts intent only on rending
their foes limb from limb. A Battle-Brother of the Blood
Angels Chapter may call out to his Primarch Sanguinius to
strengthen his arm and fill him with rage against his foes.
Until the start of his next Turn, the Battle-Brother and those
in Support Range of him add +10 to their Weapon Skill,
Strength, and Toughness, including any corresponding
increases in Strength Bonus and Toughness Bonus.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more
the bonuses to Weapon Skill, Strength, and Toughness are
increased to +20.",
