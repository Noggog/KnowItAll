	"content" : "Black Templars are among the most zealous and devoted
of the Emperor’s chosen, turning aside even the powers of the
warp with their faith. A Battle-Brother of the Black Templars
Chapter may cloak himself and those around him in an Armour
of Faith, usually by chanting prayers to the Emperor or singing
battle hymns. While this power is in effect, the Battle-Brother
and those in Support Range of him add +10 to all tests made
to resist Psychic Powers and add +4 to their Toughness Bonus
when reducing Damage from physical attacks from creatures
with the Daemonic Trait and from Psychic Powers.
<br><br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 5 or more, the
bonus to resistance tests increases to +20 and the bonus to
Toughness Bonus increases to +8.",
