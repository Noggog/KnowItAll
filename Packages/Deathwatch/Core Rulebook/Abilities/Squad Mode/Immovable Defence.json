	"content" : "Stubbornness is a valued trait among the Dark
Angels, especially in battle where they seldom give ground to
their foes even in the face of overwhelming odds. While this
ability is in effect, the Battle-Brother and those in Support
Range of him gain a +10 to all Ballistic Skill Tests, a +10 to
all Dodge Tests, and an additional +4 Armour Points to all
locations as long as they remain stationary.

<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, the
bonus to Ballistic Skill Tests and Dodge Tests is increased
to +20.",
