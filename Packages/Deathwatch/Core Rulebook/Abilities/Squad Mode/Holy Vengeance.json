Black Templars, awaiting the time when it will be unleashed
upon his foes. Until the start of his next Turn, whenever the
Battle-Brother and those in Support Range of him make a
successful Standard Attack with a melee weapon (whether
or not Damage is inflicted) they may immediately make an
additional Standard Attack with that same weapon, against
the same foe, as a Free Action. If this blow also hits, then they
may make an additional Standard Attack and so on, up to a
total number of extra attacks equal to their Agility Bonus.<br>

<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more,
summoning the Holy Vengeance is a Free Action.",
