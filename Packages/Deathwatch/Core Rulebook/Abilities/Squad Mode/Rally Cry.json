	"content" : "Ultramarines are natural leaders and the embodiment
of the Codex Astartes. In battle their purity and natural
authority is a power force, able to rally their fellow Battle-
Brothers and reinforce their will to fight. When a Battle-
Brother uses this ability, it instantly restores a number of
Cohesion equal to his Fellowship Bonus. The reverence the
Ultramarines hold for their Primarch and the strength of will
required to make a Rally Cry is such that a Battle-Brother
may only use this ability once per game session.
