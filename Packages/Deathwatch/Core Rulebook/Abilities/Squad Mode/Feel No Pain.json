	"content" : "Blood Angels often fight on regardless of the damage
dealt to them. Until the start of his next Turn, the Battle-
Brother and those in Support Range of him use their training
and the fiery will of the Blood Angel to ignore their wounds
and focus on the attack, halving all Damage (round up) after
reduction for Armour Points and Toughness Bonus. While
using this ability, however, such is the Battle-Brothers’ rage
that they may not use their Reactions to Parry or Dodge and
must use an Action with the Attack subtype (see page 236).
<br><br>
<b>Improvement:</b> If the Battle-Brother is Rank 5 or more,
the restrictions on using Reactions to Parry or Dodge can
be ignored.",
