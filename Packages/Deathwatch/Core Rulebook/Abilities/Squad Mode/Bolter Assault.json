	"content" : "Space Marines are shock troops and excel at closing
rapidly with the enemy, annihilating them in a storm of bolter
fire. When the Battle-Brother calls a Bolter Assault, both he
and those in Support Range may make an immediate Charge
Move and a Standard Attack with a bolter, bolt pistol, or storm
bolter (including variants of these weapons). Alternatively,
they may use their Standard Attack to throw a grenade.
Improvement: If the Battle-Brother is Rank 4 or more, both
he and the Kill-team can make Semi Auto Bursts and Full Auto
Bursts instead of a Standard Attack with their bolt weapons.",
