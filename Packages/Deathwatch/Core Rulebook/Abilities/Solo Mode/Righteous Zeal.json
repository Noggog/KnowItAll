	"content" : "The Black Templars are well known for their fanatical
devotion to the Emperor and their burning hatred for psykers,
witches, and warp spawn. Once per combat, a Battle-Brother of
the Black Templars Chapter may call upon Righteous Zeal as a
Free Action at the start of his Turn. While under the effects of the
Righteous Zeal, Damage inflicted by the Battle-Brother’s melee
attacks against creatures with the Daemonic Trait is not reduced
by Toughness Bonus. In addition, the Battle Brother’s own
Toughness Bonus is increased by +4 when reducing Damage
from attacks by creatures with the Daemonic Trait or Damage
from Psychic Powers and weapons. Righteous Zeal lasts for a
number of Rounds equal to the Battle-Brother’s Rank.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above the Battle-Brother
gains an additional +10 to hit and +2 to Damage rolls
when making melee attacks against any creature with psychic
abilities. At Rank 5 and above, the increase to Toughness
Bonus rises to +8. At Rank 7 and above the Warp Weapons
Trait no longer has any effect on the Battle-Brother. All of
these improvements only apply during Righteous Zeal.",
