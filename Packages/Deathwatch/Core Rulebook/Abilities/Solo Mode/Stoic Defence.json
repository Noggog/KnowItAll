	"content" : "Dark Angels are stubborn in attack and intractable in
defence, holding their ground against even the most furious
of assaults. Once per combat a Battle-Brother of the Dark
Angels Chapter may enact a Stoic Defence. The Space Marine
gains 6 Temporary Wounds and his maximum Movement
Rate is reduced to 1/2 his Agility Bonus, rounding up (most
Space Marines with this ability hold their chosen position
and do not advance or retreat!). Unlike normal Wounds, these
bonus Wounds are removed when affected by the Damage
of any successful attack, and are always removed first before
applying Damage to the Battle-Brother's normal Wounds.
These bonus Wounds will also be lost if the Battle-Brother
leaves his chosen location either by his own choice or
involuntarily.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above the temporary Wounds
increase to 12. At Rank 5 and above the Battle-Brother may
move a number of metres equal to his Agility Bonus each
round without losing the effects of the ability. At Rank 7 and
above the temporary Wounds increase to 18.",
