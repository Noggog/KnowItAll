Russ, the Space Wolves have almost preternatural senses
that exceed even those of other Space Marines. Whenever a
Battle-Brother of the Space Wolves Chapter is in Solo Mode
he may re-roll any failed Perception-based Tests and counts
as possessing the Dark Sight Trait. However, it is important
to note that none of these bonuses apply if the Space Wolf
is wearing a helmet for a sealed set of armour (e.g., Power
Armour, Artificer Armour, or Terminator Armour).<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above the Battle-Brother adds
+10 to all Perception-based Tests. At Rank 5 and above, he
gains the Unnatural Perception (x2) Trait while using this
ability. At Rank 7 and above the Battle-Brother’s senses are
such that once per game session he can automatically pass any
test based on Perception (for purposes of Opposed Tests the
Battle-Brother is considered to have rolled a 01).",
