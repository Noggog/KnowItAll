	"content" : "A Space Marine’s physiology and his training give him an
incredible tolerance to pain, injury, and wounds. Once per game
session, a Battle-Brother may call upon his Renewed Vigour. This
is a Free Action that can be done at the start of any of his Turns.
For a number of Rounds equal to his Rank, he can ignore the
effects of a single critical hit, such as Stunning, levels of Fatigue,
or unconsciousness. Note, however, this does not allow the use
of limbs that have been completely blown off or critical hits that
result in death. Also, any new critical hit effects suffered during
the Renewed Vigour affect the Battle-Brother as normal.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 5 the Renewed Vigour also restores a
number of Wounds to the Battle-Brother equal to his Rank. At
Rank 7 the Battle-Brother can ignore all of the critical hit effects
he is currently suffering from for the duration of the ability.",
