	"content" : "A Battle-Brother can call on reserves of speed when
needed, crossing great distances to close with the foe. Once
per game session, a Battle-Brother can perform a Burst of
Speed. This ability increases the character's Agility Bonus by
2 with all the usual associated benefits for a number of
Rounds equal to his Rank.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above Burst of Speed also
adds a +10 to all Agility tests based on movement. At Rank
5 the bonus to Agility Bonus increases to +4. At Rank 7 this
ability allows the Battle-Brother to ignore the need to make
Agility Tests when running or charging in difficult terrain.",
