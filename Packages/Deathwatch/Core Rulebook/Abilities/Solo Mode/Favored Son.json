	"content" : "The Ultramarines consider themselves a pure
expression of the Codex Astartes and among the truest of
the Emperors sons. This pride and unshakable personal belief
often manifests itself in their leadership abilities and the
example they set to other members of the Adeptus Astartes.
While in Solo Mode, a Battle-Brother of the Ultramarines
Chapter may re-roll any Fellowship Tests when dealing with
either Space Marines or members of the Imperial armed forces
(i.e. Imperial Guard, Imperial Navy, etc.).
In addition, their strength of leadership means that the
Battle-Brother adds +1 to the Kill-team’s Cohesion if he is
the squad leader. This bonus to Cohesion remains active even
when the Battle-Brother is not in Solo Mode.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above once per combat the Battle-
Brother may automatically pass one Command Skill Test. At Rank
5 and above the Dispositions of all Imperial forces
and agents are improved favourably by one step when dealing
with the Battle-Brother. At Rank 7 and above the Battle-Brother
adds +2 to his Kill-team’s Cohesion rather than +1.",
