	"content" : "Blood Angels possess a savagery in combat that has
its roots deep in the history of their Chapter. It is, however,
a trait that can serve them well in close quarters combat
where strength and speed are vital. Once per combat, a
Battle-Brother of the Blood Angels Chapter may summon up
a Blood Frenzy. While under the effects of this ability, the
Battle-Brother may re-roll Damage dice with melee weapons.
In the case of melee weapons that inflict multiple dice of
Damage, all dice or none must be re-rolled. In addition, such
is the brutality of his attacks that he scores Righteous Fury
(see page 245) on a dice result of 9 or 10 rather than just
10. This ability lasts a number of rounds equal to the Battle-
Brother’s Rank, divided by 2 (rounding up).<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above the Penetration of any
melee weapon attacks by the Battle-Brother are increased
by +2. At Rank 5 and above this additional melee weapon
Penetration rises to +4. At Rank 7 and above the chance
of scoring Righteous Fury increases to a dice result of 8, 9,
or 10.",
