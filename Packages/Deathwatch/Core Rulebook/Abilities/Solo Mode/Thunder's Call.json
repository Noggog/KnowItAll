	"content" : "Storm Wardens often choose to prove their honour
and bravery by facing foes in single combat and duelling to
the death. Once per combat as a Free Action, a Battle-Brother
of the Storm Wardens Chapter may issue a Thunder’s Call
against any single enemy which can both see and hear him
(though it need not be able to understand his language). As
long as the Battle-Brother takes no Actions other than melee
attacks against the target or moving him into melee with the
target, and none of his allies attack the target, he gains +10
to Weapon Skill Tests against it. In addition, as long as the
Battle-Brother is engaged in melee combat with the target,
it suffers –10 to make attacks against anyone but the Storm
Warden and must pass a Challenging (+0) Agility Test to
move away.
his ability lasts until either the target is dead or withdraws
from combat (i.e. it retreats and combat ends) or the Battle-
Brother withdraws from combat.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement:</b> At Rank 3 and above the Battle-Brother’s
duelling skills mean that he may re-roll both Parry and
Dodge Tests against attacks from the target of his Thunder’s
Call. At Rank 5 and above the target’s penalties to attack
anyone other than the Storm Warden increase to –20 and the
Agility Test to move away becomes Hard (–20). At Rank 7
and above he may issue the Thunder’s Call to a group of foes
up to his Rank in number.",
