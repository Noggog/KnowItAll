	"content" : "A Tyranid creature with this trait will be reduced to acting
according to their instincts if they are separated from the
controlling presence of the Hive Mind. In effect, this means
that any encounter in which creatures with this trait are not
accompanied by a Tyranid creature with the Synapse Creature
trait (see page 135 in this chapter), they will behave in a
particular way. The creature’s instinctive behaviour is noted
in parenthesises and has the following effects:<br>
<b>Feed:</b> The creature’s instinct is to feed on flesh, blood, and
bone and its hunger can never be sated. The creature will try
to find and attack any living, biological, non-Tyranid creature
and eat them. In this state, the creature gains the Fearless and
Frenzy talents. The same applies to a Horde with this trait not
under the influence of a synapse creature.
<br><b>Lurk:</b> The creature’s instincts are to find shelter from
attack, to hide and survive. It will try to flee and find shelter in
whatever way the situation allows. In a starship, for example,
it may scuttle into the ducting system. When confronted, the
creature’s aim is to try to escape and will only attack if left
no avenue for escape or in order to survive. If a Horde with
this trait is not under the influence of a synapse creature, it
will automatically break (see Breaking a Horde on page 360
of this chapter).
<br><b>Stalk:</b> The creature’s instinct is to remain unseen, to find
prey, slay it, feed, and then resume its hunt for others. In
this state, the creature gains the Stealth (Ag) +10 skill. It
will not attack enemies unless it can take them by surprise or outnumbers them. Having made a kill, the creature briefly
feeds before fleeing. A horde with this trait automatically
breaks (see Breaking a Horde on page 360 of this chapter),
with individual creatures scattering to find shadows from
which to begin their hunt.",
