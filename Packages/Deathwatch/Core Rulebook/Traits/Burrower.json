soil, rock, sand, and so on, though some (expressed in the
creature‘s entry) can burrow through metal. When a creature
burrows, it leaves behind a tunnel. Creatures of one size
smaller than the creature that created the tunnel can enter
these areas without impediment. There is a 50% chance each
