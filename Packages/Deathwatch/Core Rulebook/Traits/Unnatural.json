	"content" : "One or more of the creature’s Characteristics is unnatural.
Each time this trait is gained, select a Characteristic, and
double its bonus. For example, a creature with a Strength
of 41 normally has a 4 Strength Bonus. With this trait, its
Strength Bonus increases to 8.
The trait may be gained multiple times. Each time, you
may select a new Characteristic or one chosen previously.
Each time you apply this trait to the same Characteristic, the
Bonus multiplier increases by 1. For example, one selection
multiplies the Characteristic Bonus by ×2, two selections by
×3, and three selections ×4. Note this trait does not modify
the creature’s movement.<br>
During Opposed Characteristic Tests, on a success, the bonus
multiplier is added to the degree of success. Any additional
multipliers for Unnatural Characteristics (i.e., if a Space Marine
with Unnatural Strength (x2) uses a Powerfist, which doubles
the user’s Strength Bonus), simply improves the existing
multiplier by 1. For a Space Marine using a Powerfist, he
would triple his Strength Bonus rather than doubling it and
then doubling it again.<br>
When taking a Skill Test based upon a Characteristic
with the Unnatural trait, the base Difficulty of the Test is
staged downwards one level for degree of multiplier past
normal (to a maximum of +30), For example: the Archmagos
Voltaic has a Dark Age of Technology cortical implant giving
him Unnatural Intelligence (×3). He is called on to repair a
damaged plasma core using his Intelligence based Tech Use
skill. Normally this would be a Very Hard (–30) Test, but
thanks to his Unnatural Intelligence the Difficulty is reduced
by two stages to Difficult (–10), (–1 stage for ×2, and –1
for ×3).<br>
During Opposed Characteristic Tests, where success is
achieved, the Unnatural multiplier is added to the degrees of
success. In the case of a tie, the participant without the Unnatural
Characteristic trait loses the Opposed Test.
<br>For example: Garm
Felbood is struggling with a tentacled monstrosity from the
swamps of Dusk. Garm has Strength 40 and the thing from the
swamp has Strength 33 (Unnatural (×2)). Garm rolls 20 (two
degrees of success) and the thing rolls 30 (straight success),
unfortunately the thing adds +2 degrees of success because of
its (×2) modifier, bringing the Opposed Test to a draw. This
translates to a victory to the swamp thing as it has Unnatural
Strength and poor old Garm does not!",
