	"content" : "The soul of this creature is bound to a higher purpose or
being, in return for a measure of protection. When this trait
is first gained, the entity to which the soul is bound must
be decided. Many Imperial psykers, especially Astropaths,
are soul-bound to the Emperor, for example, whereas Chaos
Sorcerers may be bound to one of the ruinous powers. A soulbound
psyker rolls an additional die when forced to roll on
the Perils of the Warp table, discarding whichever one he
chooses to get a more favourable result.<br>
Upon becoming soul-bound, a character must choose
one of the following effects: 1d10 Insanity Points, the
permanent loss of their sight, permanent loss of 1d10 from
one Characteristic, or a random mutation.<br>
In addition, a soul-bound character is permanently
indebted to the entity, which undoubtedly entails all manner
of other duties and consequences.",
