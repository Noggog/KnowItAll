	"content" : "Certain spirit-beings and denizens of the warp have the
ability to possess mortal bodies. This is a far more insidious
and damaging process than most forms of mental control, or
even the power of the strongest psykers to ‘ware’ the bodies
of others, as the very fabric of the assaulting warp being is
merged with the victim’s living body on a fundamental level
so as to allow it to remain in our reality. The mechanisms by
which these possessions occur in the game are detailed below,
although circumstance and the nature of the entity itself may
vary. Note that Daemonhosts, being extraordinary powerful
examples of deliberate, ritualistic possessions, designed to
bind and control daemons in living vessels, are a special case
and dealt with separately.
<br><br><b>The Possession Attack</b><br>
The entity must be within a few metres of its intended
victim and use a Full Action. The creature and target make
Opposed Willpower Tests each round until either the entity
or the victim achieve a total of five degrees of success over
the other—this is cumulative over several rounds. If the entity
wins, it successfully possesses its victim. If their victim wins,
he has repelled the entity who may not attempt to possess
him again for 24 hours. A repelled entity also takes 1d10
points of damage.
<br><br><b>The Effects of Possession</b><br>
A possessing entity takes control utterly, binding itself to its
victim, and is capable of commanding the body to function
regardless of pain and injury, (and indeed might delight in
damaging or altering it to suit its whims). The victim increases
its Strength and Toughness Characteristics by 10 and gains
1d10 Wounds. The victim uses the possessing entity’s
Intelligence, Perception, Willpower, and Fellowship, and uses
the entity’s Psy Rating and powers in place of its own (if
any). Likewise, the possessed creature uses any mind-related
skills and talents had by the entity and loses its own.
The entity may also attempt to recall memories and skills
from its victim with a successful Intelligence Test. In the case
of possession by daemon the victim has a good chance of
becoming immediately mutated, and likely becomes further
mutated the longer the possession continues.
<br><br><b>Surviving Possession</b><br>
Should the victim survive and the entity is cast out by
exorcism or some other means, then the ordeal deals 2d10
points of permanent damage to the character’s Toughness and
Willpower Characteristics. In addition, the victim gains 1d10
Insanity Points.",
