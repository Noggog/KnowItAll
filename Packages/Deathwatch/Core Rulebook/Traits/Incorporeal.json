incorporeal creature gains a +30 bonus on Concealment
Tests when hiding inside something. If it wishes, it may
become completely silent, automatically passing any Silent
Move Tests it is required to make.
An incorporeal creature is also immune to normal
weapons—they simply pass through its body as if it wasn't
there. Daemons, psychic powers, warp creatures, other
incorporeal creatures, and opponents armed with force
weapons may all injure an incorporeal creature normally. An
incorporeal creature can't normally affect the mortal world,
and thus can't damage non-incorporeal opponents unless
it has a suitable special ability or talent. Creatures with
the Incorporeal trait can damage other creatures with the
Incorporeal trait normally.
Certain devices can keep an incorporeal creature at bay,
most notably the Gellar Field of a spaceship. Creatures with
this trait cannot pass through such a field.",
