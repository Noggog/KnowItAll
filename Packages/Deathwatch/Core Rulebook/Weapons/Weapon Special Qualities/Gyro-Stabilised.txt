built towards the end of the barrel. While not as powerful as a
suspensor, the gyro-stabiliser helps keep the weapon levelled at
the optimal angle for firing. A Gyro-Stabilised weapon never
counts its target as being further than Long Range (normal
maximum range still applies). Heavy weapons with this Quality
reduce the penalty for firing without Bracing to -20."
