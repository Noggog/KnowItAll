	"content" : "A Twin-linked weapon represents two identical weapons
connected together and linked to fire at the same time, often
through one pull of the trigger or push of a button. Twin-linked
weapons are built this way in order to increase the chances of
scoring a hit through the crude expedience of blasting more
shots at the target. A weapon with the Twin-linked Quality
gains a +20 bonus to hit when fired and uses twice as much
ammunition. In addition, the weapon may score one additional
hit if the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees of success.
Lastly, the weapon's reload time is doubled."
