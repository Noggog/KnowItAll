increasing their Damage and Penetration. Such modifiers
are already included in the weapon's profile. When the
wielder successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack
made with a weapon that lacks this Quality, he has a 75%
chance of destroying his attacker's weapon. Weapons with
the Warp Weapon Trait and Natural Weapons are immune to
this effect."
