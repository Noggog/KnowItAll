surge of energy. A target that takes at least 1 point of Damage
from a Shocking weapon after Armour and Toughness Bonus
must make a Toughness Test. He receives a +10 bonus for
every Armour Point on the location hit. If he fails, he is
Stunned for a number of Rounds equal to half the Damage
he suffered."
