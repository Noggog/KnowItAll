Anyone that takes Damage from a Toxic weapon after
reduction for Armour and Toughness Bonus must make a
Toughness Test with a –5 Penalty for every Point of Damage
suffered. Success indicates no further effect from the weapon.
Failure, however, deals an immediate 1d10 points of Impact
Damage to the target with no reduction from Armour or
Toughness Bonus."
