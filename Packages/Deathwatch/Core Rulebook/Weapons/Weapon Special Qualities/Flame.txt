	"content" : "Flame weapons project a cone of flame out to the Range of
the weapon. Unlike other weapons, flamers have just one
range. When fired, they cast fiery death out to this distance.
The wielder does not need to Test Ballistic Skill; he simply
fires. The flame's path is a cone-shaped area extending in a
30 degree arc from the firer out to the weapon's Range. Any
creatures caught in it must succeed on an Agility Test or be
struck by the flames and take damage normally. If they take
damage, they must succeed on a second Agility Test or catch on
fire. (For the effects of being on Fire, see page 260.) Cover does
not protect characters from attacks made by Flame weapons.
Normally, when a weapon is fired without the appropriate
Weapon Training Talent or a heavy weapon is fired without
bracing, the wielder suffers a -20 or -30 penalty respectively
to his Ballistic Skill Test. When a wielder who does not possess
the appropriate Weapon Training Talent fires a weapon with
the Flame Quality, anyone in the area of effect gains a +20
bonus to his Agility Test to avoid damage. This bonus rises to
+30 if the weapon is heavy and the wielder is not braced."
