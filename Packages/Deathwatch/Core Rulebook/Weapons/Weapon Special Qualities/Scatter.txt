fired, hitting more of the target. If fired at a foe within Point
Blank Range, every two degrees of success indicates another
hit (use Table 8-2: Multiple Hits on page 239). However,
at longer ranges this spread of small projectiles reduces its
effectiveness. Double all Armour Points against hits from
Scatter weapons at Long or Extreme Range."
