	"content" : "A weapon with the Storm Quality unleashes shots at rapid
speed, often through use of a double-barrelled design. This
Quality doubles the number of hits inflicted on the target
and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when
firing a weapon with the Storm Quality in fully automatic
mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (to a
maximum of twice the weapon's Full Automatic rate of fire)."
