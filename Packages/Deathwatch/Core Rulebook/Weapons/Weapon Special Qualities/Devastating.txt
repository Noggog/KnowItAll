pure destructive power, a Devastating weapon shakes the
confidence of a Squad struck by it. If the weapon hits, it
does one additional point of Cohesion Damage regardless
of Damage to Wounds, in addition to secondary effects on
Cohesion from the hit's Damage and other results. If the target
is a Horde, it reduces its magnitude by a number equal to the
number in parenthesis every time it is hit by this weapon."
