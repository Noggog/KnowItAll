	"content" : "Certain weapons are prone to overheating, either because
of poor design or because they fire unstable superheated
ammunition. A weapon with this Quality overheats on an
attack roll of 91 or higher. When this happens, the wielder
suffers energy damage equal to the weapon's damage with
a Penetration of 0 to an arm location (the arm holding the
weapon if it was fired one-handed, or a random arm if it
was fired with two hands). The wielder may choose to avoid
taking damage by dropping the weapon. Dropping a weapon
is a Free Action. A weapon that overheats must spend the
round afterwards cooling down and may not be fired again
until the second round after overheating. A weapon with
this Quality does not Jam, and any effect that would cause a
Jam (i.e., certain psychic powers) instead causes the weapon
to overheat."
