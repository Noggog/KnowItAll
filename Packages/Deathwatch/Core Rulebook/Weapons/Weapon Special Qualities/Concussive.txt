When you strike an opponent with a Concussive weapon, he
must make a Toughness Test at a Difficulty of -10 per degree
of success by which the attack succeeded or be Stunned for
1 Round. Auditory protection confers a +10 bonus to this
Test, but does not negate the kinetic energy of the blast.
Additionally, any target taking Damage greater than his
Strength Bonus from a Concussive weapon is automatically
knocked down."
