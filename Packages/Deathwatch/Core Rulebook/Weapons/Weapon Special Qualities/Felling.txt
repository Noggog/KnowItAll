of toppling even the mightiest foes. If the weapon hits, it
ignores a number of levels of Unnatural Toughness possessed
by the target equal to the number in parenthesis. For instance,
a Felling (1) weapon ignores the benefits of Unnatural
Toughness (x2) and would reduce the benefits of Unnatural
Toughness (x3) by one multiplier."
