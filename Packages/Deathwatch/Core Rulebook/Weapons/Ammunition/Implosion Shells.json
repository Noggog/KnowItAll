	"content" : "The result of early experiments with alternative krak
technology, an implosion shell replaces its explosive core
with an infinitesimal amount of antimatter; this creates a
violently decompressing vacuum when exposed to matter.
Like the standard bolt shell, these rounds activate via their
mass-reactive core, meaning they embed partially in their
target before the implosion takes effect. The round's force
is therefore not directed at cracking open armour, but to
collapsing the unfortunate victim's body from the inside
out—enough to debilitate even a Space Marine.",
