	"content" : "A work of art as much as a weapon, these
weapons are created by skilled artificers and are often
centuries old. All Master-Crafted weapons add 2 to
the Damage they inflict. Ranged weapons of Master
craftsmanship never Jam or Overheat. If a roll would
result in either occurrence, count it as a miss instead.
Master-Crafted melee weapons add a +10 bonus to
Weapon Skill Tests."
