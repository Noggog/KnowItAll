	"content" : "The finest armours and most powerful shields are all products
of the followers of the machine god, based on the fabled and
ancient designs of man's glorious past. With years of training,
a Techmarine can learn to enhance these protections, or use
them in their optimum fashion. The Techmarine increases the
Armour Points of any armour he wears by 2 on all locations it
would normally cover as long as he has at least an hour each
day to bless and prepare the armour. This bonus applies only
to armour worn by the Techmarine.",
