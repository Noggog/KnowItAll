the function of his Autosanguinators. By spending 10 minutes
in meditation and ritual incantation, the character may make
a Tech-Use Test, and if successful, remove 1d5 points of
Damage. If the character rolls a 96-100, he overstrains his
implants, losing the ability to use them for one week. During
