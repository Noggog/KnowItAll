	"content" : "When facing massed enemy, the Battle-Brother’s firepower is
laid down in precise patterns and well trained rhythm, so that
they create a storm of iron that kills and maims many. By such
discipline, the Battle-Brother has faced enemies many times
his number and emerged victorious. When using a flamer or
firing a Semi or Full Auto Burst against an enemy with the
Horde trait, the Battle-Brother doubles any Damage that he
deals to the Horde’s Magnitude. For example, if the Battle-
Brother’s attacks would reduce the Horde’s Magnitude by 5,
this amount is doubled to 10.",
