humans, regardless of their ability to hear, within a 50-meter
radius treat the character as if he had a Fear Rating of 1. While
incanting the dirge, the character may not communicate in
any other way. The rite requires one-Half Action chanting
in Techna-Lingua, and most would not consider halting
the incantations prior to their completion. Humans without
auditory augmentation cannot hear infrasonic sounds, and
though still affected do not know the character is speaking.",
