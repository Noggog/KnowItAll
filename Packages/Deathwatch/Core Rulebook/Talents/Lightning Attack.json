The use of Lightning Attack may not be combined with Dual
Strike. If the character has the Two-Weapon Wielder Talent and

of Lightning Attack with only one of the weapons, and a single

Wielder Talent and is wielding a melee weapon in one hand and
a gun in the other, they gain the advantage of Lightning Attack
with the melee weapon and a single attack with the gun.",
