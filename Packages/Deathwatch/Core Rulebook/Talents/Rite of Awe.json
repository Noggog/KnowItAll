	"content" : "The augmetic blessing of the Omnissiah on the character’s
voice box allows him to recite infrasonic liturgies that trigger
awe and fear. All humans, regardless of their ability to hear,
within a 50-meter radius feel a sense of dread and take a
–10 penalty to their next Skill Test (including Weapon Skill
and Ballistic Skill Tests). Player characters may ignore these
effects with a successful Willpower Test. Whilst incanting
the rite, the character may not talk or communicate with
others. The rite requires one-Half Action speaking the litany
in Techna-Lingua, and it is considered very bad form to
break off the recitation before completion. Humans without
auditory implants cannot hear infrasonic sounds, and though
still affected do not know the character is speaking.",
