	"content" : "The character has replaced the creative half of his brain with
sacred cranial circuitry. The character can no longer feel
emotion, and instead embraces the crystal purity of logic.
The character is immune to Fear, Pinning, and any effects
that stem from emotional disturbance. The character’s GM
removes any Mental Disorders that no longer apply, and grant the character appropriate new ones of equal severity. The
character’s comrades may find the character somewhat cold,
though other followers of the Omnissiah will rejoice in the
character’s newfound freedom.",
