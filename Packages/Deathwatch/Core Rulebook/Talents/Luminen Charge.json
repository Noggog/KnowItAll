	"content" : "The character has mastered the union between his holy
mechanical elements and his mortal flesh, allowing the
former to power the latter. With a successful Toughness
Test, the character may recharge or power machinery with
his internal coils. This requires one minute of meditation and
ritual incantation. The difficulty of the Toughness Test varies
depending on the nature of the powered system:
<br>
<br>
Ordinary (+10): Simple Power Cell, Illuminator<br>
Challenging (+0): Weapon Charge Pack, Data Slate, Bridge Termina<br>
Difficult (-10): Hotshot Charge Pack, Shuttle Electronics, Servo-Skull<br>
Hard (-20): Lascannon Charge Pack, Servitor, Bridge Hololith<br>
Very Hard (-30): Ship's Cogitator Core, Reactor Machine Spirit, Xenos Tech
<br>
<br>
The character must pass a Toughness Test when he uses
this ability or gain a level of Fatigue. No matter the power
bestowed upon the character by the Omnissiah, some systems
are either too large or too alien for this Talent—the GM is
the final judge.",
