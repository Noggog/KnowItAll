him; when all seems lost, he stands defiant and by his deeds
raises the warrior spirits of his comrades. If the squad has
suffered Cohesion Damage caused by the enemy in the
present or previous Round, the Battle-Brother may declare
that his next Action is an act to demonstrate that the squad is
unbowed and unbroken. His next Action may be one of the
following: a ranged attack against the enemy, a melee attack
against the enemy, or a Challenging (+0) Fellowship Test
that represents a roar of defiance or exhortation to heroism. If
the test involved in the Action (the attack roll or Fellowship
Test) succeeds, then the Battle-Brother and those within
Support Range of him regain all of the Cohesion they lost to
Cohesion damage in this or the last round.",
