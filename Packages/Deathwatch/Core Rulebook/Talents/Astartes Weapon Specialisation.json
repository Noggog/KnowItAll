with a particular type of weapon so that it becomes a tool of
perfect destruction. When this Talent is taken, a type and class
of weapons must be specified, such as bolt (pistols) or melee
(chain). This Talent may be taken multiple times for different
types and classes of weapons. When using the specified type of
