Though there are many different types of Mechadendrite,
this Talent divides them into two broad categories:<br>
<b>Servo-Arm:</b> Servo-arms are powerful mechanical arms fitted
with piston-driven claws that are equally effective as weapons
as they are at repairing machines.<br>
<b>Weapon:</b> Mechadendrites of this type end in either ranged
or close combat weapons, and have the supplemental support
and strength necessary for combat. Servo-Arms and the
Servo-Harness may also count as this type.<br>
<b>Utility:</b> Including such varied types as Machine Spirit
Interface, Manipulator, Medicae, Utility, Optical, and
countless others, these Mechadendrites generally require less
hardy mountings, but all interface with the Cyber Mantle in
a similar manner.",
