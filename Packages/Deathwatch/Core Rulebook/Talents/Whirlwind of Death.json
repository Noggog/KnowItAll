becomes a whirlwind of death, moving, hacking, gutting, and
beheading with ceaseless fury. When attacking an enemy with
the Horde trait in close combat, the Battle-Brother doubles
any Damage dealt to the Horde's Magnitude. For example,
if the Battle-Brother's attacks would reduce the Horde's
Magnitude by 3, this amount is doubled to 6.",
