	"content" : "The character has proven his devotion to the Machine God by
lacing anti-grav coils through every portion of his body. Using
a Half Action, the character may hover 20-30 centimetres off
the ground for a number of minutes equal to 2d10 plus the
character's Toughness Bonus. The character must employ a
Half Action each Round to concentrate on maintaining this
rite, but any Move Action allows the character to move up to
his running speed. The character can slow his rate of descent
when falling so long as this rite is active when the character
reaches the ground, taking no falling Damage. Each time the
character enacts this rite, it drains 50% of the power stored
in his Potentia Coil.",
