<br><b>Example:</b> Agamemnon takes a grievous wound from a
tyranid warrior. After reduction for Armour and Toughness,
the Scything Talon strike still does 8 Damage. Unfortunately,
it's been tough going and Agamemnon only has 4 Wounds
remaining, which would normally result in 4 points of Critical
Damage. However, since he has the True Grit Talent, he only
takes 2 points of Critical Damage.",
