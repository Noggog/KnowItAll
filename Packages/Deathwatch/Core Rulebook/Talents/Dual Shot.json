	"content" : "The character's skill with guns is such that he can target
two shots on exactly the same point. When armed with two
pistols, the character may fire both simultaneously as a Full
Action. A single Ballistic Skill Test is made, and if successful,
the character hits his target with both shots. As the character
is firing both guns as a single attack, he may take an Aim
Action before firing to get a +10 or +20 bonus to the BS
Test, and a red-dot laser sight mounted on any one of the
weapons provides its +10 bonus. The character does not suffer
from the normal -20 Ballistic Skill penalty for wielding two
weapons. If the attack hits, the target's armour gets applied as
normal to both hits individually, but Toughness only counts
once against the combined damage rolls of both hits. A single
successful Dodge Test from the target avoids both shots.",
