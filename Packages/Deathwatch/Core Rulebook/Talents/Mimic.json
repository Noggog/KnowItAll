	"content" : "Vox synthesisers, training, or innate abilities allow the
character to accurately mimic the voice of another. The
character must study the voice patterns of his intended
target for at least one hour for proper imitation, and speak
the same language. The character cannot accurately copy the
voice of a xenos due to the difference in physiology and the
subtle complexities of most alien languages. Listeners must
succeed on a <b>Difficult (-10) Scrutiny Test</b> to penetrate the
deception. If the character's study used vox recordings or
comm-link conversations rather than in-person observation,
the Difficulty of the Scrutiny Test is reduced to Challenging
(+0). The character's deception automatically fails if the
listener can clearly see him.",
