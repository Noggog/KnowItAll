	"content" : "The character's temper and passion boil just below the surface
of his psyche, mostly held in check by his rational mind, but
easily released when needed. If the character spends one full
Round fuelling his anger—by flagellation, drugs, or other
means—on the next Round he goes into an uncontrolled rage,
gaining a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill, Strength, Toughness,
and Willpower, but suffering a -20 penalty to Ballistic Skill
and Intelligence. The character must attack the nearest enemy
in melee combat if possible. If he is not engaged with the
nearest enemy, he must move towards that enemy and engage
it if possible. The character will not take obviously suicidal
actions such as leaping off a building in order to engage
someone on the ground, but he will take any actions that
have a reasonable opportunity to engage in melee with the
nearest enemy. While Frenzied, he is immune to Fear, Pinning,
Stunning effects, the effects of Fatigue, and he may not Parry,
retreat, or flee. He remains Frenzied for the duration of the
combat. Unless the character has a Talent that allows him to
do so, he may not use Psychic Techniques whilst in Frenzy.
Some beings are either permanently Frenzied or can Frenzy
at will.",
