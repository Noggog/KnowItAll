	"content" : "The skill of an Adeptus Astartes with bolters of all types can
be honed by training and combat, allowing Space Marines to
unleash devastating volleys of disciplined fire that cut down
their enemies like the sweep of a scythe. When firing any
class of Bolt weapon on Full or Semi-Auto, the Battle-Brother
may opt to increase the weapon's rate of fire by +1 (this
bonus applies to any and all bolt weapons wielded by the
Space Marine, meaning that if he is firing more than one bolt
weapon at a time, the bonus will apply to all such weapons).
This Talent only applies to personal weaponry and does not
impact vehicle-mounted weapons of any kind.",
