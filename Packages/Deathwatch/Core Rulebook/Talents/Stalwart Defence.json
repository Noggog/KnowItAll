he were made of rock and iron against which foes break like
water against a cliff. The Battle-Brother may spend a Fate
Point as a Full Action to adopt a Stalwart Defence. While
adopting this condition, the Battle-Brother may not move
and may not Dodge. He may make a Parry reaction against
all successful strikes against him, and all Damage he suffers
is reduced by -2. Furthermore, the character's enemies gain
no benefits for outnumbering the Battle-Brother in close
combat. These effects last until the Battle-Brother chooses
to end his Stalwart Defence or until he is rendered incapable
of fighting.",
