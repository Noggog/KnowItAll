	"content" : "The character is implanted with anti-grav coils throughout his
lower body, allowing him to hover just off the ground. Using
a Half Action, the character may hover 20–30 centimetres
off the ground for a number of minutes equal to 1d10 plus
the character’s Toughness Bonus. The character must employ
a Half Action each Round to maintaining the rite, and may
use the other actions to move normally. The character may
activate this rite to slow his rate of descent when falling,
reducing all falling Damage to 1d10+3 Impact. Each use of
Maglev Grace exhausts the power stored in the character’s
Potentia Coil, and so this Talent cannot be reused until the
Coil has been recharged (usually 1d5 hours).",
