on a scale of 1 to 10, where Psy Rating 1 is the lowest to
warrant the attentions of the Scholastica Psykana and the
Black Ships, and a rating of 10 represents one of the most
powerful of the entire human sphere. A Librarian begins play
with Psy Rating 3, as detailed on page 80 of Chapter II:
Specialities. See Chapter VI: Psychic Powers for detailed
rules on the game mechanics of this ability. Increasing a
character’s Psy Rating represents that character unlocking
more of his psychic potential and becoming more and more
powerful. A character may take this Talent multiples times.
Each time this Talent is taken, the character’s Psy Rating is
increased by 1. An increase in Psy Ratings in Deathwatch
does not give additional Psychic Powers.",
