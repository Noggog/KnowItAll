with deft same mastery. The character’s exceptional education
in use of the Narthecium, med-slate, and supplemental drugs
give his patients an enormous advantage. The character gains
a +10 bonus on all Medicae Tests. If treating a Heavily or
Critically Damaged patient, a successful test heals 2 Wounds
instead of 1. If the patient is in danger of losing a limb from
a Critical Hit (see Chapter VIII: Combat), the character
provides the patient with a +20 bonus to the Toughness Test
to prevent limb loss.",
