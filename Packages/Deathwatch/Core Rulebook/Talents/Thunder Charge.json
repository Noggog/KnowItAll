	"content" : "The Battle-Brother charges into combat using his armoured
body as an additional weapon. Driven by his armour and
the Battle-Brother's enhanced muscle, the impact of such a
charge is like being struck by a thunderbolt. When the Battle-
Brother makes a Charge Action, first make an unarmed attack
(see page 245 for more details) against every opponent he is
charging. This represents slamming into the enemy with the
character's armoured bulk. This attack automatically also has
the potential to knock the opponent down in the same way
as if the Battle-Brother had used the Knock Down Action
see page 241 for more details). Once this attack has been
resolved, the Battle-Brother may make his normal Charge
Attack as normal. If the Battle-Brother charges a Horde, he
may make d5+1 unarmed attacks against the Horde.",
