<h2>Background</h2>
The Blood Angels are the noble descendants of that most
puissant and angelic of the primarchs—Sanguinius.
They are perhaps one of the most celebrated Chapters
in the entire Imperium, their countless heroic deeds and
victories known to untold billions of the Emperor’s subjects
across the length and breadth of the Imperium. The beauteous,
angelic visages of the Chapter’s heroes adorn gothic facades
and stained glass windows in a million holy basilicas, and
their portraits gaze serenely from endlessly copied and much
cherished illuminated tomes.<br>
Yet, hidden from the multitudes, the Blood Angels harbour
a terrible curse. When their beloved primarch was slain at the
hands of the arch-traitor Warmaster Horus at the very height
of the Horus Heresy, every Blood Angel was doomed to share
a portion of the pain inflicted upon his flawless form. From
that day forth, every Blood Angel has been tormented by
visions of the last moment of Sanguinius. The older the Space
Marine gets, the more frequent and debilitating such waking
nightmares become. Should he not fall in battle, every Blood
Angel will one day become so consumed by these soul-searing
visions that he will descend into a madness in which he must
witness the death of Sanguinius over and over again, ever
unable to intervene as the warmaster enacts his vile treachery.<br>
The very inevitability of their curse ennobles the Battle-
Brothers of the Blood Angels, driving them ever onwards
to a glorious death in the name of the Emperor and
their primarch. Where lesser men might have
surrendered to the dark urgings to shed the
blood of the enemies of the Emperor, the
Blood Angels have remained pure and
noble for ten thousand years. Despite
this, the Chapter is dying, for each year
ever more of its brethren succumb to
the so-called Red Thirst—the desire to
rend limb from limb those responsible
for the death of Sanguinius, and
by extension every enemy of
the Emperor.<br>
The death of Sanguinius represents
one of the most perfidious and tragic
moments of the Horus Heresy, for he
died at the hands of his brother-primarch,
the arch-traitor Warmaster Horus. Although some say
that the sacrifice weakened the Warmaster just enough
to allow the Emperor to defeat him, the death of Sanguinius
is mourned to this day, and felt keenly by the Blood Angels, in
whose veins his blood still pumps. When war calls and blood
is spilled, the Blood Angels are gripped by a fury born of the
last moments of their primarch’s life. For some, the thirst is
too great and they are entirely overcome by what is called the
Black Rage, cursed to end their days reliving their beloved
primarch’s death over and over again.
<br><br>
<h3>The World of Blood</h3>
The Blood Angels hail from a trio of worlds—the rust-red
desert planet of Baal, and its two barren moons, Baal Prime
and Baal Secundus. While Baal itself has always been a world
of red rust deserts, it moons were once paradises. Yet, at
some time around the end of the Dark Age of Technology,
utter devastation was visited upon Baal and its moons. In a
nameless, long-forgotten war, viral and nuclear weapons were
unleashed, their effects so potent that many thousands of years
later, all three worlds are still subject to deadly radiation storms.
Their surfaces are scarred by vast plains of blackened glass
and endless tracts of polluted desert. What must once have
been oceans are now poisoned seas of toxic sludge, covered
in layers of pallid dust. The people of the system must have
died in their millions. But somehow, humanity prevailed. The
populace became scavengers, picking the bones of their once
great civilisation. Many must have perished, growing sickly
and feeble as the atmosphere was radically altered. In the dark
time that followed the total collapse of their society, it is likely
that some became worse than scavengers, and turned in their
desperation to cannibalism.<br>
Upon the surface of Baal is to be found, half
buried amid oceans of dust, some evidence
of a once great civilisation - vast edifices,
incredible monuments that must have been
constructed with masterful skill to have
stood for so long. It is obvious that the
people of Baal spent their time creating
mighty statues of their rulers and their
gods, and it is through this record
that those people are known.<br>
One side effect from the
ensuing radioactive atmosphere
was inevitable. In time, the
accumulated chemical and
radioactive toxins that built
up in the survivors’ bodies
forced them to devolve into
mutants, shambling parodies
of the men their forefathers had
once been. But there were some
who held onto their humanity and
preserved some semblance of sanity, forming
tribes for mutual protection. But these were
the embattled few, as a new and savage
culture evolved amid the ruins of the old.
The only social unit remaining was the
tribe. For humanity and cannibal alike,
the only folk they could rely on were
their own kin.<br>
The people of the Baal system
became nomads, shifting from place to
place, picking the ruins clean, and warring to preserve what spoils could be gathered. They constructed
ramshackle vehicles and learned how to make rad-suits—and
more importantly, rad-counters—to protect them from their
hellish, blasted environment. The tribes fought constant wars.
Where once they had been close to paradise, now they were closer
to hell.<br>
The Blood Angels maintain their fortress-monastery on
Baal, and recruit from amongst the tribes of all three worlds.
To be chosen in such a manner is more than the greatest of
honours—it promises deliverance from the nightmarish realities
of life on Baal and its moons. Only the toughest ever earn such
honour, the vast majority eking out a short, brutal life amongst
the warring tribes and the benighted radiation deserts.
<br><br>
<h3>Initiations</h3> 
To ascertain who is worthy to join the ranks of the Blood Angels,
the youths of the pure Baalite tribes must take part in violent
games and magnificent tournaments, battling against both the
harsh landscape of their home world and, ultimately, each other.
The contests are held only once in each generation, at the very
place that Sanguinius first came to Baal—Angel’s Fall. Aspirants
must reach the so-called Place of Challenge by whatever means
they can, a process that weeds out many weaker individuals
hoping to join the ranks of the Blood Angels. They must race
across uncharted miles of hostile, irradiated desert. They must
leap from the highest cliffs, praying that the primitive assembly
of wings each bears will save them from sudden death. They
must find their way through canyons infested with gigantic,
mutated beasts. The desiccated husks of previous hopefuls bear
witness to those who undertook the trials rashly. Once they
reach the Place of Challenge, gladiatorial contests, often to the
very death, ensure that only the most skilled and determined
fighters survive.<br>
Once fifty or so victors have been separated from the
unsuccessful aspirants, they will be taken by Thunderhawk
gunship to fulfil the next stage of their trials. Those who fail
are nonetheless granted positions of honour when they return
to their tribes, for the mere fact of their having survived the
trials, even if not selected, is a great feat in itself.<br>
The successful aspirants are taken to the fortress-monastery
of the Blood Angels, where they witness sights of such
magnificent glory that many are struck down with awe. They
are taken before the full battle-brethren, and it is here that the
contrast between aspirant and Space Marine is truly evident.
Despite their youth, very few of the aspirants will be untouched
by the ravages of the blasted lands in which they have lived.
Their bodies are riddled with cankers and sores, their faces
marred by lesions. In contrast, the towering physiques of the
Space Marines around them are the very ideal of perfect beauty,
their skin smooth, their features noble.<br>
Having observed a gruelling vigil of three days and three
nights, the aspirants are led away by the Chapter’s Sanguinary
Priests, who fulfil not only the role of Apothecary, but of the
bearers of their primarch’s most sacred blood. Each aspirant
must partake of this blood, which is born in a chalice proffered
to them by a priest. Soon after sipping the precious liquid, the
aspirants fall into a profound sleep and are taken to the Hall
of Sarcophagi. The walls of this vast, cathedral-like chamber
are lined with mighty golden caskets, each twice the size of
a man. The sleeping aspirants are entombed within, dwarfed
by the size of the huge sarcophagi, and attached to an array
of life-sustaining nodes. There they remain for a full year,
fed intravenously with nutrients and injected with the Blood
of Sanguinius.<br>
As the aspirants slumber, they are engulfed by vivid and
strange dreams depicting the memories of Sanguinius himself.
Thus the very essence of the primarch permeates the minds of
his new sons, and ever afterwards these potent emotions and
memories will be permanently imprinted upon their souls.<br>
When the aspirants are finally removed from their sarcophagi,
they have been changed so thoroughly that few could believe
they were once the twisted creatures rescued from the living
hell of their prior lives. They have become tall, immensely
strong, and superhumanly powerful. Their restructured bodies
have taken on a haunting beauty reminiscent of their angelic
forefather, their senses keener, and their muscles stronger
than tempered steel. Through this arcane process and lost
technology, the scrofulous wastelander is transformed into a
being of radiant purity and noble purpose.
<br><br>
<h3>The Sons of Sanguinius</h3> 
The Blood Angels are amongst the longest-lived of all of
the Space Marine Chapters, their gene-seed granting a vastly
increased lifespan on all who possess it. It is not uncommon,
therefore, for a Blood Angel to live for a millennium or more, if
death in battle or the Red Thirst does not claim him first. These
vastly extended life spans allow the Blood Angels to perfect
their techniques in art as well as in war. They have centuries to
perfect the disciplines to which they turn their minds, and this
accounts for the fact that Blood Angels’ armour and banners
are amongst the most ornate ever produced.<br>
Following the example of their primarch, the Blood Angels
espouse a vision of the galaxy in which the enemies of the
Emperor can be defeated and mankind can progress to the life
he was always fated to live. There is a deeply mystical streak in
the Blood Angels’ doctrines, and a strong belief that things can
be made better. After all, the Blood Angels are recruited from the
scrofulous wastelanders of Baal, and if such can be transformed
into a tall, proud, and handsome warrior, then there is hope for
mankind yet. This belief can be seen in everything the Blood
Angels do. They strive for perfection in all of their endeavours.
Their works of art are things of beauty and symmetry. Their
martial disciplines are practised unceasingly. Their doctrines are
permeated with a sense of mortality and the fallen greatness
of Man.<br>
The beatific countenance and noble bearing of the Blood
Angels is in stark contrast to the curse they bear. While lesser
warriors might become morose or fatalistic, weighed down by
the inevitability of their fate, the Blood Angels remain stoic.
The Blood Angels’ cadre of Sanguinary Priests—the equivalent
of Apothecaries in other Chapters—tirelessly pursue a cure
to the Red Thirst. But each year, more and more brethren
succumb to it. Perhaps in an effort to hold the curse at bay,
many Blood Angels sleep in the same casket where their bodies
were transformed from the ravaged Baalite wastelanders to the
perfect forms they emerged as, the arcane machinery filtering and purifying their blood as they slumber. This is even true of
many Blood Angels seconded to service in the Deathwatch.
Their caskets are stored within a watch station or watch fortress,
and the Blood Angel sleeps there to heal any wounds suffered
during a mission, emerging whole and unsullied once more.<br>
The quest for perfection in all they do makes Battle-
Brothers from the Blood Angels ideal warriors to serve in the
Deathwatch, yet their curse becomes all the more terrible. A
Blood Angel may find himself isolated from others of his kin
while he serves in the Deathwatch. He appears a paragon of
virtue to his fellow Deathwatch Battle-Brothers, but by night
he fights damnation alone in his cell, praying fervently that
the curse will not claim him here, so far from his Chapter and
the Sanguinary Priests who may aid him on his final journey.
When the Red Thirst takes hold, it can only be overcome with
extreme difficulty.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3> 
The Blood Angels adhere closely to the organisation
laid down in Roboute Guilliman’s Codex Astartes, and the
Chapter’s Battle-Brothers are equipped in a similar manner to
most other Space Marines. The Battle-Brothers often display a
savage desire to engage their foes in the fury of close combat,
their rage growing all the stronger the closer to succumbing
to the Red Thirst the Blood Angel steps. Most of the time, the
Blood Angels are able to hold their curse in check, but those
they engage in assault soon discover the bloodthirsty savagery
of the sons of Sanguinius.<br>
Blood Angels are unique amongst the Space Marines in
that their gene-seed contains the encoded experience of their
Primarch, and most deeply imprinted of all is the memory of
Sanguinius’ final battle with Horus. Sometimes, on the eve of
battle, an event or circumstance will trigger this embedded
memory and the Battle-Brother’s mind is suddenly wrenched
into the distant past. The Black Rage overcomes the Blood
Angel as the memories and consciousness of Sanguinius intrude
upon his mind, and dire events ten thousand years old flood
into the present.<br>
A warrior overcome with the Black Rage appears half mad
with fury; he is unable to distinguish past from present and does
not recognise his comrades. He may believe he is Sanguinius
upon the eve of his destruction, and the bloody battles of the
Horus Heresy are raging all around him. Such a Battle-Brother
stands at the end of his travails, for his path leads only to the
Death Company, where he and the Chapter’s other damned
souls will fight one final battle in Sanguinius’ name under the
guidance of a Chaplain. These individuals each fight their own
battle, perhaps believing themselves to be waging the wars of
the Horus Heresy at the side of their beloved primarch. Death
for the members of the Death Company is a blessed mercy,
for those not consumed in the cleansing fires of battle must
be restrained and imprisoned, for their safety and that of their
brethren, until the next battle.",

Deep within the psyche of every Blood Angel is a
destructive yearning, a battle fury and blood hunger

Few Battle-Brothers can hold the Red Thirst in check
unceasingly—it is far from unknown for Blood
Angels to temporarily succumb to its lure at the height
of battle.
The Red Thirst is the Blood Angels’ darkest
secret and greatest curse, but it is also their greatest
salvation—for it brings with it a humility and
understanding of their own failings which make them
truly the most noble of the Space Marines."],

		["Primarch's Curse", "
Deep in the minds of all Blood Angels lurks the memory of their
primarch’s demise at the hands of Horus and the rage and blood
of that battle. Such is the imprint left by Sanguinius that it echoes
down his lineage and into the minds of all Battle-Brothers of the
Chapter. In battle this memory can, over time, manifest in Blood
Angels, turning them savage and blinding them to everything
but the brutality of battle and a thirst for killing.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Bloodlust):</b> The Battle-Brother cannot stand to
leave an enemy alive or end a fight without even a single kill.
If an enemy surrenders or a fight looks like it will end without
a foe’s death, the Battle-Brother must make a Challenging
(+0) Willpower Test to avoid finishing them off or hacking
down at least one foe. The GM may increase or decrease the
modifier for this test depending on the circumstance and the
ramifications of the killing.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Close Quarters Killing):</b> Those in the grip
of the Black Rage favour close melee combat, where the
blood of their foes stains their armour red. Unless there is
no possible way to close with a foe, the Battle-Brother will
always favour melee combat over ranged combat and will
charge into the fray, discarding the bolter for the hungry
teeth of a chainsword.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Uncontrollable Thirst):</b> The Black Rage is also
intertwined with another of the Blood Angels flaws: the Red
Thirst. In extreme cases, the Red Thirst translates into a literal
thirst for blood. Once a battle is over, a Battle-Brother with
Uncontrollable Thirst must make a Hard (–20) Willpower
Test or spend at least a few minutes drinking the blood of his
foes (provided of course the blood is not deadly to drink)."],
