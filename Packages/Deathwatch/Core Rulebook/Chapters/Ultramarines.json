<h2>Background</h2>
Of all the thousand and more Space Marine Chapters,
it is the blue-clad Ultramarines that, in the mind
of the countless billions of the Emperor’s subjects,
personify everything that the Adeptus Astartes stands for. The
Ultramarines and their many successor Chapters have stood at
the very forefront of the war against the traitor, the alien, and
the fiend since the very foundation of the Imperium. Across
the domains of the Emperor, the Ultramarines are celebrated
as heroic, virtuous, and noble defenders of Humanity, their
deeds celebrated in devotional works the length and breadth
of the galaxy.<br>
Even amongst the Space Marine Chapters themselves,
the Ultramarines occupy a position of special honour. The
gene-seed from which the original Ultramarines Legion was
founded is considered the purest, and it is estimated that some
two-thirds of Chapters share their inheritance, being either
direct successors or created from tithed Ultramarines genetic
material. This shared inheritance often ensures that when the
Ultramarines go to war, they are supported by many other
Chapters, and that when Space Marine commanders gather to
consider common strategy, the counsel of the Ultramarines
is greatly valued. Often, the presence of even
a small number of Ultramarines units in
a larger military undertaking will
ensure the participation of many
more Chapters, so highly are the
sons of Roboute
Guilliman held
in their brothers’
esteem.<br>
When Hive
Fleet Behemoth struck
the Eastern Fringe, it was
the Ultramarines Chapter
that turned the tide, even at the cost
of the entire First Company. At
the Chapter’s home world of
Macragge, one of the largest
battles seen in centuries was
fought, with the Ultramarines,
led by their Master Marneus
Calgar, at the very forefront. In
addition to the great honour won
by the Chapter in that titanic
struggle, the Ultramarines
gained invaluable experience
in fighting these vile xenos,
which they have passed on,
often via service in the Deathwatch, to many other Chapters.<br>
When the Horus Heresy struck, Guilliman was leading his
mighty Legion in a massive campaign in the galactic south. So
successful was the campaign that the Legion had been carried
far from the Imperium’s heart, so that by the time Guilliman
received word of the Warmaster’s treachery, the siege of Terra
was underway. The Ultramarines fought their way towards
Terra, and although they defeated a massive Traitor space
fleet, were unable to intervene in the final battle.<br>
It is Guilliman’s actions subsequent to the Horus Heresy
that made him the figure of adoration that he would become.
With the traitors scattered and the Emperor to all intents
and purposes lost to Humanity, the Imperium stood at the
precipice. It was the genius and leadership of Roboute
Guilliman that saw the Imperium through its first century, as
he kept invaders at bay and saved the scattered worlds from
collapsing into anarchy.<br>
Roboute Guilliman fell at the hands of his erstwhile
brother, Primarch Fulgrim of the Emperor’s Children Traitor
Legion. Poisoned unto death, Guilliman’s barely living
body was placed in a stasis field, and later enthroned in the
Ultramarine’s fortress-monastery. There it remains to this day,
and some say that within the timeless aura of the stasis field,
his body heals, and he may one day be returned to defend the
Imperium he strove so hard to build.
<br><br>
<h3>The Realm of Ultramar</h3>
Situated deep in the galactic southeast in Ultima Segmentum,
Ultramar is unique amongst all of the Chapter headquarters
of Space Marines, in that while most Chapters operate
from asteroid bases, lonely fortress-monasteries, and
isolated worlds, the Ultramarines
control no fewer than eight
star systems near their home
world of Macragge. Each of
these worlds has its own
government, armed forces,
and individual cultures,
but all are utterly loyal to
the Ultramarines Chapter. The
worlds surrounding Macragge
are largely industrialised,
though due to the organisational
skills and far-sightedness of the Chapter’s primarch, they
are not the polluted wastelands of similar worlds across the
Imperium. The worlds of Ultramar do not pay a tithe to
the Imperium or provide regiments to the Imperial Guard.
Instead, their every effort is devoted to the service of the
Ultramarines, the ultimate reward for which is selection
of a scion for service in the Chapter. Those families with
an ancestor who joined the ranks of the Ultramarines
are greatly honoured, and revere his name for all time.<br>
Macragge itself is mostly bleak and rocky, with
more than three-quarters of its land mass formed from
mountainous terrain nearly entirely devoid of life..
The planet is encircled by vast, nigh impregnable
orbital defences, as well as mighty fortresses at
either pole. The polar fortresses bore the brunt of the Tyranids’ attacks during the Battle for Macragge, where,
thanks to the sacrifices of the First Company, the back of the
galactic invasion was broken and Hive Fleet Behemoth defeated.
<br><br>
<h3>Duty and Honour</h3>
The Ultramarines are rightly held as exemplars of all that a
Space Marine can and should be. They are noble and virtuous,
self-sacrificing and stoic, and truthful and just in thought and
deed. Unlike the Battle-Brothers of some other Chapters,
they are not arrogant in their dealings with the common man,
and have served and died alongside warriors of every other
military force in the Imperium.<br>
This attitude is instilled in the Ultramarines from a very
young age, long before consideration is given to recruitment
into the Chapter. The people of Macragge in particular, and of
Ultramar as a whole, are raised in a culture of discipline and
service. On Macragge, it is common for a young man to leave
his family whilst still a child to learn the ways of the warrior
in one of the many martial communities of the world. In these
schools, the youngster learns of honour and duty, practising
and studying so that his arm is strong and his mind keen.
It is from these communities that many of the Ultramarine
aspirants are drawn, for they are well versed in the arts of war
and ideal candidates for recruitment into the Chapter.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3>
As befits the Chapter of Roboute Guilliman, the Ultramarines
adhere rigidly to the tenets laid down in the Codex Astartes.
For ten thousand years they have fought in the manner
described in its holy pages. Other Chapters may freely
interpret the words of Guilliman, but to the Ultramarines
such deviation is unthinkable. The Codex Astartes is a work
of divine wisdom, sanctified by the Emperor himself, and
the Ultramarines see no reason to deviate from it. The lifelong
lessons of discipline and self-reliance that are instilled
in the people of Ultramar from birth give them the strength
of character to hold true to teachings over ten thousand
years old.<br>
For any given tactical situation, the Codex offers hundreds
of pages devoted to how it may be met and overcome. Each
warrior of the Chapter is required to memorise whole sections
of the Codex so that within a company there exists an entire
record of the Codex’s tenets. The wisdom of thousands of
the Imperium’s warriors has contributed to the Codex, and
details on everything from unit markings to launching a fullscale
planetary assault are contained within its pages.<br>
This is not to say that the Ultramarines are hidebound or
unimaginative in their thinking, for it must not be forgotten
that Primarch Roboute Guilliman is regarded as one of the
most imaginative and innovative military thinkers of all time.
It is rather a deep-seated belief that every problem can be
solved with recourse to the Codex Astartes, that there is no
need to reinvent solutions to dilemmas solved long ago. By
their strict adherence to the Codex, the Ultramarines are in
fact freed by it. The success of this doctrine is self-evident in
the countless thousands of battle honours the Chapter has
earned over ten millennia of loyal service to the Imperium.

page 32) unique to Space Marines from the
Ultramarines Chapter.<br>
In all of their duties, from battle to study, the
Ultramarines are thorough, analytical, and attentive to
every detail. They are slow to anger and rarely make
a rash decision. By constant recourse to the articles
of faith enshrined within the Codex Astartes, the
Ultramarines are able to face any eventuality with wellpractised
battle drills and established doctrine.<br>
In their dealings with Battle-Brothers from
other Chapters, Ultramarines often fulfil the role of
facilitator and peacemaker. While the Battle-Brothers
of some Chapters display extremes of character,
from hotheaded to taciturn, the Ultramarines are
balanced in their approach, and often able to broker
agreements between wildly differing points of view.
This is evidenced in the fact that a high proportion of
Deathwatch leaders are drawn from the Ultramarines
and their successors, a fact that has more to do with
their outlook and character than it does with their
numerical superiority.<br>
An Ultramarine is likely to turn to the vast tracts
of the Codex Astartes that he has memorised for the
solution to a problem."],

		["Primarch's Curse", "
Battle-Brothers of the Ultramarines Chapter know well their
place among the Adeptus Astartes and the importance of their
Chapter to both the Imperium and the Emperor. They have
the pride in knowing that theirs is the pinnacle of the Codex
Astartes and the legacy of the loyalist legions which served
the Emperor in his darkest days. It is a pride, however, that
can sometimes blind them to reality and make them arrogant
and uncooperative when the battle would dictate they work
with lesser warriors.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (The Emperor's Finest):</b> Ultramarines consider
themselves the Emperor’s favoured sons and the pride of
the Imperium. This can lead members of the Chapter to
consider others incapable or unable to complete missions that
should by rights fall to the Ultramarines. The Battle-Brother
always volunteers his Kill-team for the most dangerous or
challenging Missions whenever possible and always ensures
his team is where the fighting is the thickest.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Sons of the Codex):</b> The Battle-Brother has
been trained to follow the Codex Astartes to the letter
and interpret its teachings flawlessly. Understandably, he is
distrustful of those Chapters that do not adhere to the Codex.
The Battle-Brother cannot benefit from Squad Mode Actions
called by Space Marines of the Space Wolves or Black
Templars Chapters, as he will simply not follow their orders.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Leaders not Followers):</b> Ultramarines are
natural leaders and make excellent battlefield commanders at
all levels of command. This pride and training, however, can
lead to them scorning or disregarding the leadership of those
from other Chapter or Imperial forces. Unless the Battle-
Brother is currently the Kill-team squad leader (see page 228)
or the leader is a fellow Ultramarine, his Kill-team’s Cohesion
is reduced by 2."],
