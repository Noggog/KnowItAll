<h2>Background</h2>
Since the Imperium came into being, the Space Wolves
have fought tooth and nail for the cause of the
Emperor. Amongst the most famous of the Chapters of
the Adeptus Astartes, their sagas are told from one end of the
galaxy to the other. As headstrong as they are fierce, the Space
Wolves excel at close-quarters fighting, their warriors vying
keenly for glory on the field of battle. The Space Wolves live
to fight, and death holds no fear for them.
<br><br>
<h3>Land of Fire and Ice</h3> 
Fenris, the home world of the Space Wolves Chapter, is a
world of pain and hardship, swathed forever in freezing ice
or unforgiving fire. It drifts in the far northwest quadrant
of the galaxy, perilously close to the Eye of Terror, and yet
its denizens remain pure. From space, it is apparent that the
vast majority of Fenris is covered in ice-cold water, and what
little land mass there is floats as small islands of frozen rock
and snow. In the long, dark days of the Fenrisian winter, the
oceans freeze over entirely, swathing the planet in a hard,
white skin.<br>
One small continent remains stable throughout the
years: the land of Asaheim, which sits atop the
crest of the world. Fenris orbits its sun in a
pronounced ellipse; as a direct result,
the climate ranges from ice cold for
most of the year to searing heat in the
summer. Even at the time when Fenris
reaches its perigee, the primary
continent remains intact,
although ravaged by
blazing lava and
rivers of magma.
Tectonic plates
grind, mountains
are thrown up, and
chasms rend deep
gashes in the skin of the planet. Yet somehow,
amongst the shifting ice floes and fierce tides,
the men of Fenris thrive.<br>
As the constant ravages of the cruel and
ever-changing climate harden its people, so too
does it harden the native species. The prey, such
as the herds of giant Fenrisian elk with their
majestic and razor-sharp antlers and the hulking
mammoths that can crush
a man’s body to a pulp,
are dangerous indeed. The predators, however, are among
the most ferocious in the galaxy. Ancient drakes and wyrms
soar on the thermals above the shifting islands, thriving
in caves heated by geothermal processes. Sea serpents and
kraken haunt the deeps, terrifying leviathans that can grow
thousands of metres in length. It has even been suggested
that these kraken, one of which is said to have been caught
by Leman Russ himself, are the remnants of an unsuccessful
Tyranid invasion from the distant past.<br>
Great white bears, raging beasts that weigh as much as an
ice shark and are almost invisible in a blizzard, can be found
prowling the frozen tundra, fully capable of smashing apart
the strongest buildings to feed upon the unwary occupants.
But most dangerous of all, a predator so terrible that it is
known throughout the galaxy, is the Fenrisian wolf. These
iron-furred monsters range from the mass of a small horse to
that of an armoured personnel carrier, and are possessed of
a singular cunning. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about
these beasts is that they live in packs and, when they are
hunting, their prey has little hope of escape.<br>
Given that many Space Wolves wear the pelts of these
vicious creatures, having killed the beasts with their bare
hands, the warriors of Fenris can be reckoned mighty indeed.
Born into a world of such omnipresent danger, only the
toughest can thrive. Few worlds in the breadth of the galaxy
hold any fear for the Space Wolves of Fenris.<br>
Many Space Wolves have served in the Deathwatch,
and some of the most celebrated Battle-Brothers are drawn
from the Chapter. Their propensity to engage the foe head
on has led to many great victories, even if none outside of
the Deathwatch ever hear of them. Though many Space
Wolves have been elevated to the rank of Watch-Captain in
the Deathwatch, comparatively few have
served as Watch Commanders. It
is likely that this is due to the
brothers’ natural gregariousness,
and their desire to return to the
great feasting halls of Fenris once
their duty is done.
<br><br>
<h3>The Trials</h3> 
The Space Wolves claim to
be blessed with the most
potent of all gene-seeds.
The heritage of Leman
Russ is as unique as it
is deadly, and the first
stage of the aspirant’s
transformation is often the
last, for many are killed,
or worse, transformed into
slavering beasts. Before
the transformation can begin,
the aspirant must first imbibe the
Canis Helix. Unfortunately for many,
the genetic coding of the helix contains
a number of substances that are not
synthesised by the human body, and they have a dramatic effect upon the potential Space Marine. The ravages of this unique gene first take effect during the
aspirant’s indoctrination. Ultimately, he is cast out into the
wilderness to make his own way back to the Fang—the
Space Wolves’ mighty Fortress-Monastery. The gene works
its hideous changes upon the warrior’s mind and body; he
reverts to a primal state where his bones split and buckle, hair
sprouts across his body, and his only desire is to gorge on
fresh meat and blood. His body mass grows by almost eighty
percent, many of his bones fuse, and vestigial fangs sprout
from his gums as he undergoes the transformation. Whilst his
body is wracked with pain, the warrior must overcome the
gene, lest it overcomes him. The nights of Fenris are prowled
by giant, feral creatures, known as the Wulfen, the vestiges of
aspirants who have failed to overcome the curse. To become
one of the Wulfen is to fail and truly become a monster.<br>
If the aspirant finds his way back to the Fang across the
chasms and glaciers populated by snarling predators and
blasted by freezing winds, he is implanted with the remainder
of the Space Wolves’ gene-seed, stabilising the Canis Helix
and completing his genetic indoctrination into the ranks of
the Sons of Russ. A minority of these warriors do not entirely
conquer the gene-seed’s effects, however, and in times of
great stress will revert to the hulking, bloodthirsty state that
haunts their genetic structure. This is the Curse of the Wulfen,
and it is rightly feared.
<br><br>
<h3>Combat Doctrine</h3>
The Space Wolves have a very different approach to martial
strategy from many of their brother Space Marines. There
are several distinct types of squad, or pack, unique to the
Chapter. Due to the Canix Helix in the Space Wolf gene-seed,
Space Wolves experience their canines continuing to grow
throughout their life-span. As a Space
Wolf progresses through his life, he may rise through the
ranks until he is old and his fangs are long. If his bravery and
might are proven beyond question, he may be invited to join
the Wolf Guard, or even become a mighty Wolf Lord and lead
one of the Chapter’s Great Companies.<br>
Most Space Wolves begin their careers as Blood Claws, hotheaded
young warriors who cannot wait to prove themselves,
charging in howling packs at the front lines of the enemy
in their efforts to garner personal glory. The Blood Claws
are the shock troops of the Space Wolves and spearhead the
majority of assaults. If they survive to become mature and
capable warriors, they will be elevated to the ranks of the
Grey Hunters, tempered by battle but nonetheless ready
to give their lives in the name of honour. When the Space
Wolves are fully mature, their hair grey and their canines
pronounced, they are likely to be inducted into the Long
Fangs, veteran warriors who are disciplined and steady even
in the heat of battle, and hence entrusted with the company’s
heavy weapons.<br>
The bravest and strongest of the Space Wolves, after proving
themselves in a feat of exceptional valour or martial prowess,
may become Wolf Guards. It is not by age or maturity that
one attains such a coveted rank, but by deed, and so a newly
raised Blood Claw has the same chance of joining the ranks
of the Wolf Guard as does a veteran Long Fang. The Wolf
Guard may lead less experienced packs into battle, or form
a retinue for the mightiest warrior of the Great Company—
the Wolf Lord himself. Few can stand before these heroic
warriors, equipped as they are with the best wargear in the
company’s armoury, making them virtually unstoppable in
close combat.<br>
The Space Wolves’ combat doctrine is not as organised as
that of their brother Chapters. Given that they live for the
honour of battle, it is almost certain that the younger Space
Wolves will abandon a standard tactical structure in favour
of simply rushing headlong at the enemy, howling at the
tops of their voices. This has been known to aggravate allies
from other units, who must adapt their battle plans in the
face of the Space Wolves’ actions. However, far from being
uncontrolled berserkers, the Space Wolves simply relish the
thrill of close combat above all else. Nonetheless, their battle
tactics are undeniably effective; the Space Wolves have fought
in such a manner on a hundred thousand battlefields since
their conception, and a hundred thousand battle honours
bear witness to their bravery.",

The Battle-Brothers of the Space Wolves are ferocious and aggressive warriors. Though far from mindless berserkers,
they are certainly possessed of a feral exuberance for battle. They have an overriding sense of duty and honour, and
are driven ever onwards by a strong desire to right the many wrongs that have befallen the Imperium of Man since the
heady days of the Great Crusade. Space Wolves exhibit a fierce sense of loyalty to their comrades in arms and this is on
occasion extended to their compatriots in other branches of the Imperium’s military.<br>
Although as devoted to the Emperor as any other Space Marine Chapter, the Space Wolves express their faith not in
prayer and piety, but in feats of arms. While the Battle-Brothers of other Chapters may spend the night before battle in
solemn meditation, the Space Wolves are more likely to mark the eve of battle in bawdy celebration, raising overflowing
jacks of Fenrisian ale to brothers they may be mourning once battle is done. A Space Wolf will drink and make merry,
for tomorrow, he may die.<br>
In temperament, most Space Wolves are blunt and plain speaking, even to the point of giving offence to those not
used to their ways. They abhor pretension and despise politicking. They are honest to a fault, and expect the same
quality in those they fight alongside. Space Wolves embrace their lot with an uncomplicated enthusiasm, from the
headstrong, newly recruited Blood Claw to the grey haired and taciturn Long Fang. Each plays the role fate lays before
him, knowing that a life spent in service to the Emperor is a life well lived.<br>
In the face of an enemy attack, the warrior bounds forward like a Fenrisian wolf on the hunt, a joyous song of war
on his lips."],

		["Primarch's Curse", "
There is a savagery and animal fury that lurks in the hearts of
all Space Wolves making them powerful warriors and deadly
combatants. This bestial nature can lead them astray and
overpower their natural reason and sense of order, as they are
ruled by their animal instincts and react not as the man but
as the warrior wolf.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 1 (Shadow of the Wolf):</b> The wolf lurks close to the
surface in the Battle-Brother and he feels its call in his blood.
This can be unsettling for others, especially those not of the
Adeptus Astartes. The Battle-Brother’s Fellowship is reduced
by –10 when dealing with Space Marines who are not part of
his Kill-team, and –20 when dealing with everyone else.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 2 (Prey's Scent):</b> The keen senses of a Space
Wolf can be as much a curse as a boon. Sometimes they can
overpower the Battle-Brother, temporarily robbing him of his
senses. The first time a foe is bloodied by the Space Wolf in
battle (i.e. as soon as he inflicts at least 1 Wound on an enemy)
he must make an Easy (+20) Perception Test. If he passes
the test, he may only take a Half Action on his next Turn as his
nostrils are flooded with the spore of his prey.<br>
<br>
<b>Level 3 (Fight or Fight):</b> The Battle-Brother finds it hard
to back down from fights in the face of naked aggression.
Whenever the Space Wolf would be required to give ground or
make a tactical retreat from foe (i.e. disengaging from combat),
he must make a Hard (–20) Willpower Test to do so."],
