	"content" : "The enemies of Mankind can attack in vast numbers; howling
heretics, skittering Hordes, and ranked warriors. Alone,
such enemies would stand no chance against the might of
the Adeptus Astartes. Together in large groups, however, they can
pose an overwhelming threat. Hordes have the potential to defeat
the Emperor's finest by sheer weight of fire and numbers. The
rules presented here are intended to help Games Masters reflect
these massed forces that the Deathwatch may face in battle.
It is important to note that not every enemy is suitable to form
a Horde. The GM should use his discretion to decide whether or
not an enemy can form a Horde. For example, it is unlikely that
50 jungle snakes would be a threat to a Space Marine, even as a
Horde! However, 50 Tyranid Hormagaunts will certainly threaten
a Kill-team of Deathwatch Space Marines.
When a creature has a special Quality for its attacks (e.g.,
Tearing or Toxic), the default method is to apply that Quality to
all of the attacks for a Horde made up of that creature. However,
the GM should use his discretion for when the Quality should
not apply (for instance, if over half of the creatures in the Horde
do not possess that Quality). Also, the GM should be aware that
special Qualities for the Horde's attacks can make an encounter
with a Horde particularly dangerous for the Space Marines, and
adjust accordingly.
<br>
<br>
<b>Using a Horde</b><br>
A Horde should be treated by the Games Master as a single vast
creature. The Horde has the same profile as the base creature which
makes up its numbers. A Chaos Heretic Horde, for example, has
the same profile as an individual Chaos Heretic on page 364,
for example. The only exception to this is that a Horde replaces
the individual creature's Wounds value with its Magnitude and
location based armour with a single armour value.

A Horde is a vast number of one type of enemy or creature
attacking in large numbers. The abstract number of enemies
making up such a Horde are reflected in the Horde's
Magnitude. This represents the Horde's determination and
numbers as an abstract value: one point of Magnitude does
not equal one individual enemy or creature.<br><b><br>
Horde Traits</b><br>
A creature entry may have a Trait listed that has (Horde)
written next to it. These Traits represent the way particular
creatures fight in large numbers, and only apply when that
creature is used as the basis of a Horde.
<br><br>
<b>Attacking a Horde</b><br>
A character can damage a Horde by shooting it with ranged
weapons or attacking it in melee. These attacks are treated
as if they are against a single creature even though they may
represent mowing down ranks of enemies or scything through
many foes.<br>
Characters must still roll to hit a Horde, but the appropriate
size bonus should apply to these tests based on the Horde's
Magnitude.<br>
Weapons that can fire on full, or semi-auto will cause additional
hits. These hits must be allocated against the Horde and not any
individual Lieutenants or Masters that may also be present.
<br><br>
<b>Table 13-1: Example Horde Magnitudes</b>
<br>Magnitude 30 (Mob): Massive (+30)
<br>Magnitude 60 (Phalanx): Immense (+40)
<br>Magnitude 90 (Mass): Monumental (+50)
<br>Magnitude 120+ (Tide): Titanic (+60)
<br><br>
<b>Damaging a Horde</b><br>
• Each hit that causes any amount of damage reduces a
Horde's Magnitude by one. Therefore, an attack that,
after accounting for armour and Toughness Bonus, causes
15 points of damage reduces the Horde's Magnitude by
1. The deliberate consequence of this is that sustained
fire and blast weapons are much more effective against
Hordes than weapons which fire only one shot; a
lascannon is a weapon for destroying tanks not mowing
down large numbers of infantry.<br>
• Weapons that inflict Explosive Damage (X) gain a
bonus against Hordes, and count as having inflicted one
additional Hit.<br>
• Locations are not used when fighting a Horde.
• A Horde has a single armour value at is applied to all
damage rather than different armour values for different
locations.<br>
• Hordes may be Pinned as normal (with the entire Horde
making a single Willpower Test). However, Hordes gain
a bonus to their Willpower Tests to resist pinning equal
to its Magnitude.
<br><br>
<b>Melee</b><br>
When fighting against a Horde in Melee, a Space Marine
inflicts one hit for every two Degrees of Success on his
Weapon Skill Test. Melee weapons with the Power Field
Quality inflict one additional hit.
<br><br><b>Blast Weapons</b><br>
A Blast weapon that hits a Horde hits a number of times equal
to its Blast value. So a grenade with Blast (4) will automatically
hit four times if successfully lobbed into the Horde.
<br><br><b>Flame Weapons</b><br>
A flame weapon used on a Horde will hit it a number of times
equal to one quarter of the weapon's range (rounding up),
plus 1d5. So a flame weapon with a range of 10 will hit a
Horde 1d5+3 times.<br>
<br><b>Psychic Powers</b>
<br>Psychic Powers used against a Horde will hit it a number of
times equal to the Psy Rating used in the power, no matter
what the power may be. If the psychic power affects an area,
it adds an additional 1d10 hits. At the GM's discretion, if
a particular psychic power does not inflict damage (such
as Compel), it still inflicts “hits,” meaning that portions of
the Horde have been convinced not to attack, and so forth.
Furthermore, the GM should take care to adjudicate the
effects of certain psychic powers (such as Vortex of Doom)
in specific situations against Hordes (such as a Horde tightly
packed into a small space).<br>
<br><b>Breaking a Horde</b><br>
• When a Horde's Magnitude is reduced by 25% in a turn,
it must make a Willpower Test when it is its turn to act
again. If it passes, it may continue to act. If it fails, it
breaks and flees at its highest move value.<br>
• If the Horde's Magnitude is less than 50% of its starting
value, it suffers a -10 to the Willpower Test. If the
Horde's Magnitude is less than 25% of its starting value,
it will automatically break.<br>
• Hordes composed of enemies with the Fearless talent do
not have to test to see if they break as their Magnitude is
eroded: they have to be wiped out to the last.
<br>
<br><b>Hordes Attacking</b><br>
A Horde can make both melee attacks against enemies in close
proximity and ranged attacks at enemies that are at a distance
in a single turn as an attack action.<br>
<b>Melee:</b> A Horde will attack all adjacent enemies, or
enemies that are in close proximity (the GM is the final arbiter
of whether a target is in close proximity or not) if not using
a map; if there are five Battle-Brothers in close proximity of a
Horde all will be attacked. A Horde that has multiple attacks
from being armed with two weapons or the Swift Attack or
Lightning Attack Talents may use its full number of attacks
against every eligible target. Although a Horde represents a
large number of attackers, a Horde does not gain the benefits
of Ganging Up (see page 248). Instead, the Horde's sheer
weight of numbers is represented by the fact that its target
may not Dodge or Parry. Melee Attacks made by Hordes
cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted.
<br><b>Ranged:</b> A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the
first digit of its Magnitude. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can
make two ranged attacks. Any additional hits from sustained
fire can be applied to any eligible target. Therefore, if the
heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra
hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to
Brother Silas.<br>
Modifiers or range and sustained fire apply as normal, but
a Horde can never aim.<br>
Ammo expenditure and Jamming are never applied to
Hordes—they always have enough bullets to keep firing.
<br><br>
<b>Damage Caused By Hordes</b><br>
Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes
increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde's Magnitude
divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of +2d10. This is
in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that
the Horde is armed with. It will also include the Strength
Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons. The
damage is reduced by the target's Toughness bonus and
armour as normal. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics
armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a
heretic would do with its axe (1d10+5), and therefore causes
3d10+5 damage if they hit in combat. Likewise, the same
mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10+2 damage with
its ranged attacks. This represents an enemy being mobbed
with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking
like rain on a single target."
