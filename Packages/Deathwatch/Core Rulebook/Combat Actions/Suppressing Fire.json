	"shortContent" : "Fire on all targets within a 45 degree kill zone. They must take a -20 Pinning Test and you may must make -20 BS test to see if any friend or foe is hit. GM determines randomly who is hit. Every 2 degrees of success is another bullet that hits.",
	
	"content" : "The active character unleashes a devastating hail of firepower to
force his opponents to take cover. This action requires a weapon
capable of fully automatic fire (see Rate of Fire, page 141). When
Suppressing Fire is declared, the active character establishes
a kill zone (or uses one previously established, see Overwatch,
page 241), which is any general area, such as a corridor or
treeline, that encompasses a 45 degree arc in the direction the
active character is facing. Then, the active character fires a fully
automatic burst and expends the appropriate ammo. All targets
within the kill zone must take a Hard (-20) Pinning Test or
become Pinned (see page 248). Additionally, the active character
must make a Hard (-20) Ballistic Skill Test to determine if
his wild spray of gunfire hits anyone, friend or foe, within the
kill zone. A roll of 94-100 on the test indicates the weapon has
Jammed (see Weapon Jams, page 249). If the Ballistic Skill Test
succeeds, the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the
kill zone. Furthermore, every two Degrees of Success score an
extra hit against another random victim. Use of the Suppressive
Fire action does not affect the defensive benefits of armour or
cover. The number of hits scored may not exceed the weapon's
fully automatic Rate of Fire. Use Table 8-2: Multiple Hits to
determine Hit Locations for multiple hits against the same target.
The active character cannot choose to fail this Ballistic Skill Test.
Note that Suppressing Fire is a separate Full Action from Full
Auto Burst and therefore does not benefit from the+20 attack
bonus Full Auto Burst provides.",
