If the active character is controlling the Grapple, the first thing
he must do on his Turn is declare Grapple as a Full Action in
order to maintain the Grapple; if he does not declare Grapple as
a Full Action, the Grapple immediately ends. After that, hThis action is only used when a character is already engaged in a

If the active character is controlling the Grapple, the first thing
he must do on his Turn is declare Grapple as a Full Action in
order to maintain the Grapple; if he does not declare Grapple as
a Full Action, the Grapple immediately ends. After that, he can
choose one of the following Controller Grapple Options:


Controller Grapple Options:

• Damage Opponent: The controller of the Grapple can
attempt to damage his opponent with brute force by making
an Opposed Strength Test with the Grappled opponent.
If the active character wins, he inflicts unarmed Damage
(1d5-3+SB with Armour Points counting double) to his
opponent's body location and one level of Fatigue. If the
Grappled opponent wins the Opposed Strength Test, no
Damage is dealt, but he is still Grappled. This action can
benefit from Assistance.


• Throw Down Opponent: The controller of the Grapple
can attempt to wrestle his Grappled opponent to the
ground by making an Opposed Strength Test. This test
can benefit from Assistance. If the active character wins,
the Grappled opponent becomes prone.


• Push Opponent: The controller of the Grapple can attempt
to force his Grappled opponent to move. This is resolved
with an Opposed Strength Test, which can benefit from
Assistance. If the active character succeeds, he pushes his
opponent one meter in a direction of his choice, plus one
additional metre for each Degree of Success. This pushed
distance cannot exceed the active character's Half Move
distance. The active character must move with his Grappled
opponent in order to maintain the Grapple, or he can
choose to let go of his opponent, which ends the Grapple,
but allows the active character to keep his ground.


• Ready: The controller of the Grapple can ready one
of his own items. Or if the GM allows, he can use the
Ready Action to grab an item belonging to his Grappled
opponent.


• Stand: If both Grappling participants are on the ground,
the controller of the Grapple can regain his feet with this
action. He can also attempt to drag his Grappled opponent
up with him by making an Opposed Strength Test. This
test can benefit from Assistance. If the controller of the
Grapple wins, both participants stand.


• Use Item: The controller of the Grapple can use a
readied item.


If the active character is the target of the Grapple, the first
thing he must do on his Turn is declare Grapple as a Half
Action—this is part of the penalty for being Grappled. After
that, he can choose one of the following Grappled Target
Options:


Grapple Target Options

• Break Free: The Grappled target can attempt to break
free of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength Test
with the controller of the Grapple. This test can benefit
from Assistance. If the active character wins, he breaks
free and may perform any Half Action.


• Slip Free: The Grappled target can attempt to wriggle
out of the Grapple by making a Challenging (+0)
Contortionist Skill Test. If he succeeds, he slips free and
may perform any Half Action.


• Take Control: The Grappled target can attempt to take
control of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength
Test with his Grappling opponent. This test can benefit
from Assistance. If the active character wins, he becomes
the controller of the Grapple and his opponent becomes
the Grappled target. The active character may then
immediately perform one of the Controller Grapple
Options, but he cannot take any other Half Actions.


Size Differences

If one participating Grappler is larger than the other (see page
249), the larger Grappler counts an extra Degree of Success
per size category difference on all successful Opposed Tests
performed within the Grapple.",
