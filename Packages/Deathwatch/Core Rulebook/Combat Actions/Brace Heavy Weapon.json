	"content" : "Heavy weapons must be braced before they can be fired
accurately. Bracing a Heavy weapon can involve using a
bipod or tripod, propping the weapon up on a windowsill
or sandbags, or simply assuming a wide stance or kneeling.
When a Heavy weapon is fired without being braced, the
attacker suffers a -30 to his Ballistic Skill Test. Once a Heavy
weapon has been braced, the firer cannot move without losing
the benefits of bracing. However, the firer can still traverse
his weapon 45 degrees or more depending on the type of
bracing. Melee, Thrown, Pistol, and Basic weapons gain no
special benefit from bracing.",
