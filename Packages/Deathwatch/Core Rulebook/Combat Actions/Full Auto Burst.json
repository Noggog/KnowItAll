	"content" : "The character hurls a roaring burst of fully automatic gunfire
at his enemies. The attacker must be wielding a ranged
weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this Action.
If the character has a pistol in each hand, both capable of
fully automatic fire, he may fire both with this Action (see
Two-Weapon Fighting, page 246). The attacker makes a
Ballistic Skill Test with a +20 bonus. A dice result of 94 to
00 indicates the weapon has Jammed. If successful, the attack
scores a hit normally. Furthermore, each Degree of Success
scores an extra hit. The number of extra hits scored in this
manner cannot exceed the weapon’s fully automatic Rate of
Fire. Extra hits can either be allocated to the original target
or any other targets within two metres, provided none of the
new targets would have been harder to hit than the original
target. If extra hits are allocated to the same target, use Table
8–2: Multiple Hits to determine the extra Hit Locations.
Remember, the first hit is always determined by reversing
the numbers of the dice result made to perform the test (see
The Attack, page 244). A character using this Action with a
Pistol- or Basic-class weapon may also move up to his Agility
Bonus in metres. However, if he does so, he gains no bonus to
his Ballistic Skill Test and instead suffers a –10 penalty.


If the weapon has the Scatter special quality and is fired
with a Full-Auto Burst at Point Blank Range, any extra hits
from Scatter and Full-Auto Burst are calculated separately and
both applied.",
