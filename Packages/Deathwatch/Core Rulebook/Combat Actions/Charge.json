	"content" : "The character rushes at his target and delivers a single
melee attack. The target must be at least four metres away,
but still within the attacker's Charge Move. See Table 7-4:
Movement (Meters/Round) on page 205. The last four
metres of the Charge must be in a straight line so the attacker
can build speed and line up with his target. The attacker gains
a +10 bonus to his Weapon Skill Test made at the end of the
Charge. If the Charging character is unarmed, he can attempt
to Grapple his opponent instead of inflicting damage. See
Grappling, page 240.",
