	"content" : "If the active character is unarmed or armed with a melee weapon,
he can strike to Stun instead of attempting to land a killing blow.
The attacker makes a Hard (–20) Weapon Skill Test. If the
attack succeeds, roll 1d10 and add the attacker’s Strength Bonus.
The target then rolls 1d10 and adds his Toughness Bonus +1 per
Armour Point protecting his head (if the attack is unarmed, or if
the attacking weapon is Primitive, the Armour Points are doubled).
If the attacker’s roll is equal or higher, the target is Stunned for a
number of Rounds equal to the difference between the rolls, and
he gains one level of Fatigue.",
