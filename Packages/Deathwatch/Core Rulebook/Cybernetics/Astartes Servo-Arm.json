	"content" : "Techmarine servo-arms are powerful manipulators tipped with
crushing pincers, useful for field repairs and punishing enemies.
Ports for these detachable appendages are installed at the shoulder,
and the Battle-Brother's armour must also be upgraded with more
powerful gyro-stabilisers to use one effectively. So supported, a
servo-arm can lift one side of a Rhino APC to repair a broken
tread link.

A servo-arm can extend up to 1.5 metres. A Techmarine uses
the arm's Strength value of 75 with Unnatural Strength (X2)
rather than his own (this value cannot be increased or decreased
through devices or abilities that affect the Techmarine's strength).
The limb's gripping mandibles allow the Techmarine to lift heavy
objects or anchor himself to a suitable point as a Free Action.

Astartes servo-arms are more than just repair tools, and make
deadly weapons. The Techmarine may strike with the arm as his
Reaction for the round, or as a Standard Attack during his turn
(so long as the servo-arm only makes one attack per round). This
attack uses the Techmarine's Weapon Skill, and deals 2d10+14
Impact Damage with Pen 10. Exceptional craftsmanship servoarms
increase their Strength value to
85 (increasing damage to 2d10+16)
and add a +10 to Grapple Tests.",
