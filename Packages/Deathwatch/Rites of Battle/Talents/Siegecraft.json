	"content" : "The Adeptus Astartes of the Imperial Fists Chapter are renowned for their ability to craft fortifications that have stood
the tests of the worst enemies of Mankind. If he has time to prepare the battlefield (1d5 hours at a minimum), the
Imperial Fist may improve the Armour Points of a piece of cover by a number equal to his Intelligence Bonus. At the
GM’s discretion, this effect may apply to a number of pieces of cover equal to the Space Marine’s Rank. This bonus stacks
with that of the Siege Master ability, but the bonus points are added after any effect from Siege Master. The effects of
this Talent cannot be applied more than once to any piece of cover, and the effects are permanent.",
