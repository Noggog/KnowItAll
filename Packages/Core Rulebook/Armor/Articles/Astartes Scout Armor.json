	"content" : "In most Codex Chapters, Neophyte Space Marines serve in the
10th Company as Scouts as their first assignment. Scouts are
placed under the instruction of an experienced sergeant, who
both takes command of the squad and teaches the Scouts what
it means to be a Space Marine. During this time, Scouts wear
lighter, less-encumbering armour than the power armour worn
by the Initiate Battle-Brothers of the Chapter. This armour is a
version of carapace armour that offers protection while at the
same time is extremely well-suited for stealth and skirmishing.
Astartes Scout Armour provides a +10 bonus to Concealment
Skill Tests and does not inflict a penalty to Silent Move and
Concealment Skill Tests based on AP.",
