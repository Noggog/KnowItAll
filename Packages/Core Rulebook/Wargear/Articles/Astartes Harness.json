a jump pack, this Battle-Brother-sized harness can be used to
aid in safely descending from terrain or buildings. The simple
harness fits over a character’s power amour. A hook-shaped
magnetic clip can then be anchored to a wide variety of surfaces
as the coiled safety line slowly unspools. The Battle-Brother
gains a +30 bonus to Climb Tests, and will not fall if he fails.",
