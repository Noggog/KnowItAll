	"content" : "The active character guards a specific area or target, poised to
shoot at an opportune moment. When Overwatch is declared,
the active character establishes a kill zone, which is any
general area, such as a corridor or treeline, that encompasses a
45 degree arc in the direction that active character is facing.


The active character then specifies either Full Auto
Burst, Semi-Auto Burst, or Suppressing Fire, along with the
conditions under which he will perform the chosen attack.
At any time the specified conditions are met before the start
of the character’s next Turn, he can perform that attack. If
this attack occurs at the same time as another character’s
Action, the character with the higher Agility Bonus acts first.
If both characters have the same Agility Bonus, they make an
Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first.


Additionally, targets caught in the kill zone must make a
Hard (–20) Pinning Test or become Pinned (see Pinning on
page 248). If a character on Overwatch performs any Actions
or Reaction, such as Dodge, his Overwatch immediately ends.
Note this does not include Free Actions, such as speech.",
