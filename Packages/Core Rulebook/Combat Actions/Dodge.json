	"content" : "Dodge is a Reaction that a character can perform when it is not
his Turn. After a character is hit, but before Damage is rolled,
the character can attempt to avoid the attack by making a
Dodge Test. A character must be aware of the attack in order
to make the test. If the test succeeds, the character gets out
of the way at the last moment and the attack is considered to
have missed (and thus no Damage is rolled). If the Dodge Test
fails, the attack connects and deals Damage normally. Dodge
can be used to avoid both melee and ranged attacks.
<br>
<br>
Some attacks, such as those made with grenades, flamers,
or guns firing semi-automatic or fully-automatic bursts, are
especially difficult to avoid. When Dodging an area effect
weapon (such as a flamer), a successful Dodge Test moves
the character to the edge of the area of effect, as long as it is no further away than the character’s Agility Bonus in
metres. If the character would need to move further than this
to avoid the attack, then the Dodge Test automatically fails.
When Dodging Full Auto or Semi-Auto Bursts, each Degree
of Success on the Dodge Test negates one additional hit.",
