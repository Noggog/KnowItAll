of Parrying, he can attempt to thwart an incoming melee
attack by making a Challenging (+0) Weapon Skill Test.
If the test succeeds, the incoming attack is considered to have
missed. If the test fails, the attack connects and Damage is
rolled normally. Parrying requires no special Skill or Talent,
but Parry can only be used to negate a melee attack.",
