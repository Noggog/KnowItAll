	"content" : "Sometimes the best course of action in combat is to get
away from danger by any means necessary. A character
can voluntarily flee from an opponent or be forced to flee
because of Fear, a Psychic Power, or some other effect.
When a character flees under his own control, he may
take any of the following Actions: Disengage, Move, or
Run. When a character flees against his will, he must
perform the Run Action. If a character is engaged in
melee with one or more opponents and he flees without
using the Disengage Action, each of his opponents gets
a free Standard Attack against the fleeing character. Such
a free attack is made in addition to any other attacks the
combatant receives during his Turn.",
