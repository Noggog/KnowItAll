	"content" : "Battle-Brothers of the Adeptus Astartes spend years becoming
proficient with all manner of weapons. By the time that a
Battle-Brother has entered service in a squad, he will have not
only trained with both heavy and melee weapons, but used
those weapons on countless battlefields. The Battle-Brother
is proficient with bolt, chain, melta, plasma, power, flame,
primitive (ranged and melee), las weapons, launchers, solid
projectile, and thrown weapons of all Classes. In essence, the
only weapons that the Battle-Brother is not proficient with
are exotic weapons; for these, he must acquire individual
proficiencies as normal.",
