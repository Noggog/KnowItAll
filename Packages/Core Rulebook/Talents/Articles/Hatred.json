	"content" : "The Battle-Brother spends the time before battle armouring
himself against the power of the warp by reciting canticles
and litanies of hate and contempt against the unclean powers.
This Talent may be used in the Oath Making phase before
undertaking a mission. The Battle-Brother spends a Fate
Point in the Oath Making phase and counts as having spent
this Fate Point for the duration of the mission. During the
mission, the Battle-Brother must take a Challenging (+0)
Willpower Test whenever he is the subject of the effects of
a Psychic Power, daemonic power other warp-based power.
If the Willpower Test succeeds, then the Battle-Brother is
unaffected by the power. If the Test fails, then the power
affects him as normal. The effects of this Talent also apply to
powers that cause Damage indirectly such as blasts, and those
used by friendly psykers which might be beneficial to the
Battle-Brother. A power that is resisted by a Battle-Brother
using this Talent is not nullified if others will be affected by
it as normal.",
