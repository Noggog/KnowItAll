	"content" : "The character’s skill with melee weapons can place two blows
together to maximize Damage. When armed with two melee
weapons, the character may attack with both simultaneously
as a Full Action. Make a single Weapon Skill Test. If the test is
successful, the character hits the target with both weapons. As
the character is swinging both weapons as a single attack, he
may take an Aim Action before attacking to get a +10 or +20
bonus to the WS Test. The character does not suffer from the
normal –20 WS penalty for wielding two weapons. If the
attack hits, the target’s armour gets applied as normal to both
hits individually, but Toughness only counts once against
the combined Damage rolls of both hits. A single successful
Dodge or Parry Test from the target avoids both blows.",
