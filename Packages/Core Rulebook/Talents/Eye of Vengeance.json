	"content" : "The Battle-Brother can focus his intent on where it is likely
to do most Damage to his enemy and then strike the target
down with a single shot. The Battle-Brother may declare
that he is using this Talent before he makes a single ranged
attack. If the attack hits, it ignores an additional point of
armour per Degree of Success. If a 10 is rolled for Damage,
it automatically triggers Righteous Fury without the need for
another Ballistic Skill Test. This Talent may not be used in
conjunction with Blast weapons, Semi or Full-Auto Bursts, or
Flame weapons. It may, however, be used in conjunction with
accurate weapons and in conjunction with making Called
Shots and taking Aim Actions.",
