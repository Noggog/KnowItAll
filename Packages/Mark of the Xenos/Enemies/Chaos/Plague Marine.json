	"content" : "A Space Marine’s body is hardened against every conceivable
form of attack, not least against deadly biological weapons and
engineered plagues of all kinds. Nonetheless a Space Marine can
be laid low by certain warp-spawned infections and diseases,
their fantastic constitution betraying them and trapping them
in a fevered nightmare between life and death. Lingering in the
wracking torture of their own ravaged bodies can force even a
Battle-Brother’s resolve to weaken enough to make him cry out to
the Chaos God Nurgle, the Plague Lord, for succour.",
