the deadliest kind of round in the Imperial arsenal.
The Deathwatch takes great advantage of variations
that have been made on this design over the years,
yielding a wide variety of alternate rounds that still
fire from a standard bolt weapon. The majority of
bolt shell manufacturing capacity is reserved for the
Adeptus Astartes, making them costly for others to obtain but
a matter of course among Battle-Brothers.",
