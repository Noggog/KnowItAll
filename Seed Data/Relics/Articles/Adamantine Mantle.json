	"content" : "These intricately worked cloaks take their name from the
most common variation: small adamantine scales worked
into a protective yet flexible defensive covering. Similar,
personalised designs exist, all using unbreakable materials to
form an impressive cloak. Each one is the labour of decades
by master artificers, who temper each individual scale and
thread for maximum resilience. Their work is then blessed
by Chaplains before finally being laid upon the shoulders of
its first bearer. The mantle protects him not just through its
physical strength, but also by making his movements more
difficult to predict as the opaque cloak whirls about him in
combat.

An adamantine mantle negates 2 points of Armour
Penetration from any incoming attack. The wearer gains a
+10 to his Opposed Weapon Skill Test to Feint, and if he
takes the Defensive Stance Action, foes suffer an additional
–10 on Weapon Skill Tests to attack him.",
