	"content" : "An amorphous creature has a malleable form, capable of
squeezing its body or expanding it. It can change size by one
step in either direction, though doing so does not change
its speed. Creatures with this trait determine their movement
rates using one-half their Agility Bonus (rounding up).
Amorphous creatures are often missing senses and so rely on
the Unnatural Senses Trait to perceive their surroundings.",
