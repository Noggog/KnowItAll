	"name" : "Lord of Change",
	
	"content" : "Lords of Change are creatures borne from some impossible
nightmare, immense birdlike daemons with shimmering skin,
wicked curved beaks and multicoloured, spectrum-shattering
wings. Those who gaze upon these twisted prisms of pure magic
begin to feel their sanity shred and reason slip away. Faced by
a being of change incarnate, bedrock beliefs crumble and twist,
and the mind seeks firm purchase in vain.
Treachery, deceit, capriciousness: these are the hallmarks
of the Lords of Change. Tzeentch’s greatest servants weave
scheme upon scheme, a dense tangle of intermingling threads,
so convoluted and eon-spanning that none can grasp their
true purpose.",

		["Special Rules", "<b>†Daemonic Presence:</b> All those within 25 metres of a Lord
of Change realise that they are merely the playthings of
capricious gods, beginning to doubt their every conviction.
All characters suffer a –20 penalty to Willpower Tests in
the area.
<br>
<br>
<b>Master of Plotters:</b> All Daemons of Tzeentch are master
schemers, their very essence a primal form of deceit
and treachery, and the Lords of Change are the greatest
masterminds of all. No matter the circumstances, a Lord of
Change is always ready to turn the tables on its adversaries.
Once per combat, the Lord of Change may add his Intelligence
Bonus to any one Test.
<br>
<br>
<b>Supreme Sorcerer:</b> Lords of Change know all Psychic
Powers from the Deathwatch Rulebook (and may know
more; if you have access to rogue traDer or Dark heresy,
the Lord of Change knows all Lesser, Greater, and Ascended
Psychic Powers as well, plus the Lesser and Greater Arcana
of Sorcery), and may use them as if it had a Psy Rating of 9.
A Lord of Change does not trigger any psychic phenomena.
In addition to these powers, Lords of Change may also
use the Psychic Power Bolt of Change (see page 127) and
any other psychic powers from page 127 that the GM
deems appropriate.
<br>
<br>
<b>Spawn of Fate:</b> Lords of Change are the architects of destiny
itself, capable of weaving together or severing the very strands
of fate. Though a Lord of Change does not have access to
Fate Points, whenever anyone in combat with one spends a
Fate Point, the Lord of Change regains 1d10 lost Wounds.
However, when an individual is forced to permanently
burn a Fate Point in the presence of a Lord of Change,
the Greater Daemon immediately suffers 2d10 wounds
ignoring Toughness."]
