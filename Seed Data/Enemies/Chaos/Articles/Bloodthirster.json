	"content" : "Bloodthirsters are the unholy fury of the Chaos Power
Khorne, Lord of Battles and Blood, incarnate. They are the
Greater Daemons of the Blood God, each a manifestation
of the unreasoning rage and savagery of total war. It is said
that there are no more powerful masters of battle in the entire
galaxy than the Greater Daemons of Khorne and that none
may stand before them. They are the very essence of brutality,
every blow ever struck and life ever taken distilled into a single
towering form of iron and sinew.",
