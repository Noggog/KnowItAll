	"content" : "A more powerful form of the anti-toxins found in Astartes
power armour, this drug can negate the effects of most
dangerous gases and toxins if administered quickly enough.
A dose of de-tox immediately ends the ongoing effects, both
positive and negative, of any drugs, toxins, or gases affecting
the character (unless the effect states that de-tox is not
effective against them) and renders him immune for another
1d10 Rounds. Given that natural Space Marine resilience
protects him against many of the common chemicals that
pose a threat to other beings, de-tox is manually administered
to avoid unintended interruption of injector system effects.",
