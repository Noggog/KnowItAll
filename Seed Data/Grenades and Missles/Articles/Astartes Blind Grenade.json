grey smoke including IR bafflers and broad-band
EM spectrum chaff, all designed to block eyesight and even
advanced visual detection. The effect is short-lived, but
while it lasts provides excellent cover for advancing forces.
The effects of this grenade last for 1d10 Rounds (shorter in
conditions such as prevailing winds or industrial ventilation).",
