	"content" : "With cold precision, the active character shoots a burst of
semi-automatic gunfire at his enemies. The attacker must
be wielding a ranged weapon capable of semi-automatic
fire to take this action. If the character has a pistol in each
hand, both capable of semi-automatic fire, he may fire both
with this action (see Two-Weapon Fighting, page 246). The
attacker makes a Ballistic Skill Test with a +10 bonus. A dice
result of 94 to 00 indicates the weapon has Jammed (see
Weapon Jams, page 249). If he succeeds, the attack scores
a hit normally. Furthermore, every two Degrees of Success
score an extra hit. The number of extra hits scored in this
manner cannot exceed the weapon’s semi-automatic Rate of
Fire. Extra hits can either be allocated to the original target
or any other targets within two metres, provided none of the new targets would have been harder to hit than the original
target. If extra hits are allocated to the same target, use Table
8–2: Multiple Hits on page 239 to determine the extra Hit
Locations. Remember, the first hit is always determined by
reversing the numbers of the dice result made to perform the
test (see The Attack, page 244). A character using this Action
with a Pistol- or Basic-class weapon may also move up to his
Agility Bonus in metres. However, if he does so, he gains no
bonus to his Ballistic Skill Test.


If the weapon has the Scatter special quality and is fired
with a Semi-Auto Bust at Point Blank Range, any extra hits
from Scatter and Semi-Auto Burst are calculated separately
and both are applied.",
