	"content" : "The attacker smashes his opponent in the hopes of knocking
him off his feet. Make an Opposed Strength Test. If the
attacker wins, the target is knocked prone and must use a
Stand Action on his Turn to regain his feet. If the attacker
succeeds by two or more Degrees of Success, the target also
suffers 1d5–3+SB damage, with Armour Points counting
as double, and one level of Fatigue. If the target wins the
Opposed Strength Test, he keeps his footing. If the target
wins by two or more Degrees of Success, the attacker is
knocked prone instead. If the attacker spent a Half Action to
move before performing the Knock-Down attack, he gains a
+10 bonus to the test.",
