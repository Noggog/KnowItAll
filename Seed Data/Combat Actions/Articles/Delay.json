opportunity. When a character chooses Delay, his Turn ends,
but he reserves a delayed Half Action for later use. Any time
before the start of his next Turn, the character can perform a
delayed Half Action of his choice. If the delayed Half Action
is not used before the start of the character’s next turn, it
is lost. If two or more characters both attempt to perform
delayed Half Actions at the same time, they must make an
Opposed Agility Test to see who acts first.",
